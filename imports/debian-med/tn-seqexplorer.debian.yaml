  description: explore and analyze Tn-seq data for prokaryotic genomes
  long_description: " Tn-seq Explorer allows users to explore and analyze Tn-seq data
    for\n prokaryotic (bacterial or archaeal) genomes. It implements two\n alternative
    methods for identification of essential genes and provides\n additional tools
    to investigate the Tn-seq data. The primary goal of the\n data analysis is to
    study fitness by identifying genes that are essentia"
