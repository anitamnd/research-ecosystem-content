  description: Java API for NeXML
  long_description: " Java NeXML libraries and tools\n  * model: the DOM-based core
    java 5 NeXML reading/writing API, inside\n    src/main/java as well as JUnit tests
    inside src/tets/java. The API\n    consists of interfaces in the org.nexml.model
    package and\n    implementations thereof in the org.nexml.model.impl package.\n\
    \  * mesquite_module: NeXML import/export functionality for mesquite. This\n \
    \   subfolder structure contains classess (inside src/main/java) that\n    depend
    on the org.nexml.model.* architecture. In addition there are\n    resource files:
    properties files that map between certain annotation\n    namespaces and/or predicates
    as encountered in NeXML files, and the\n    Java handler classes that are to be
    dynamically loaded to operate on\n    them; and a default Tree Style Sheet (TSS)
    file for marking up tree\n    visualizations.\n  * validator: Xerces-J-based XML
    validator (written by Terri Liebowitz\n    of the San Diego Supercomputing Center,
    with modifications by Mark\n    Holder) and a ValidateNeXML class that does essentially
    the same\n    thing, but more tailored to NeXML specifically.\n  * transformer:
    class that transforms NeXML documents into CDAO\n    documents using the xslt
    stylesheets found in $NEXML_ROOT/xslt."
