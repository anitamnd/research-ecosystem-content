    idseq.net). It is a pipelining system that implements\n a directed acyclic graph
    (DAG) where the nodes (steps)\n correspond to individual python classes. The graph
    is\n defined using JSON.\n .\n The pipeline would be executed locally with local
    machine\n resources. idseq-dag could be installed inside a docker\n container
    and run inside the container.\n .\n This package installs the library for Python
    3."
