  description: de novo repeat classification and fragment assembly
  long_description: " Repetitive sequences make up a significant fraction of almost
    any genome\n and an important and still open question in bioinformatics is how
    to\n represent all repeats in DNA sequences. We propose a radically new\n approach
    to repeat classification that is motivated by the fundamental\n topological notion
    of quotient spaces. A torus or Klein bottle are\n examples of quotient spaces
    that can be obtained from a square by gluing\n some points. Our new repeat classification
    algorithm is based on the\n observation that the alignment-induced quotient space
    of a DNA sequence\n compactly represents all sequence repeats. This observation
    leads to a\n simple and efficient solution of the repeat classification problem
    as\n well as new approaches to fragment assembly and multiple alignment."
