  description: Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2
  long_description: " The MOFA2 package contains a collection of tools for training
    and\n analysing multi-omic factor analysis (MOFA). MOFA is a probabilistic\n factor
    model that aims to identify principal axes of variation from data\n sets that
    can comprise multiple omic layers and/or groups of samples.\n Additional time
    or space information on the samples can be incorporated\n using the MEFISTO framework,
    which is part of MOFA2. Downstream analysis\n functions to inspect molecular features
    underlying each factor,\n vizualisation, imputation etc are available."
