  description: error-tolerant peptide identification
  long_description: " BICEPS is tool for the error-tolerant identification of peptides
    based\n on a statistical regularization scheme. It balances possible\n improvements
    in peptide-spectrum-matches by allowing substitutions\n against the increased
    risk of false positives. BICEPS can identify\n peptides containing two or more
    substitutions as occuring e.g. in\n cross-species searches. "
