  description: Re-implementation of the Caesar III engine with gameplay changes
  long_description: " Augustus is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3,
    with mostly the\n same logic as the original, but with some gameplay and UI enhancements:\n
    .\n  - Roadblocks\n  - Market special orders\n  - Global labour pool\n  - Partial
    warehouse storage\n  - Increased game limits\n  - Zoom controls\n  - Support for
    widescreen resolutions\n  - Windowed mode support for 32-bit desktops\n  - Several
    small in-game quality of life improvements\n .\n Augustus requires the original
    assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Caesar 3 to\n run. It optionally supports
    the high-quality MP3 files once provided on the\n Sierra website.\n .\n Because
    of gameplay changes and additions, save files from Augustus are NOT\n compatible
    with Caesar 3 or Julius. Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 save\n files, but not
    the other way around. If you want vanilla experience with\n visual and UI improvements,
    or want to use save files in base Caesar 3, check\n Julius."
