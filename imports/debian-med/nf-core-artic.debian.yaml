  description: nf-core ARTIC field bioinformatics viral genome pipeline
  long_description: " RNA-seq workflow for nextflow, meant to form a a bioinformatics
    pipeline\n for working with virus sequencing data sequenced with nanopore. This
    is\n a reimplementation for the nextflow workflow suite of the ARTIC\n fieldbioinformatics
    protocol.\n .\n This package at the very moment is not much more than a technical
    exercise.\n Upstream tagged it as \"under development\" - and that is what it
    is here,\n too."
