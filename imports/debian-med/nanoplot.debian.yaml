  description: plotting scripts for long read sequencing data
  long_description: " NanoPlot provides plotting scripts for long read sequencing
    data.\n .\n These scripts perform data extraction from Oxford Nanopore sequencing
    data\n in the following formats:\n .\n  * fastq files (optionally compressed)\n\
    \  * fastq files generated by albacore, guppy or MinKNOW containing additional\n\
    \    information (optionally compressed)\n  * sorted bam files\n  * sequencing_summary.txt
    output table generated by albacore, guppy or\n    MinKnow basecalling (optionally
    compressed)\n  * fasta files (optionally compressed)\n  * multiple files of the
    same type can be offered simultaneously"
