  long_description: " The goals of CTK are as follows:\n    * Provide a unified set
    of basic programming constructs that are useful for\n      medical imaging applications
    development\n    * Facilitate the exchange and combination of code and data\n\
    \    * Document, integrate, and adapt successful solutions\n    * Avoid the duplication
    of code and data\n    * Continuously extend to new tasks within the scope of the
    toolkit\n      (medical imaging) without burdening existing tasks\n .\n This package
    provides the CTK header files required to compile C++ programs\n that use CTK."
