  long_description: " Molekel is an open-source multi-platform molecular visualization
    program.\n .\n Some of the features are:\n  * Different methods to speed-up rendering
    of molecules with support\n    for billboards and view-dependent level of detail
    techniques\n  * Programmable shaders; standard shaders to enhance rendering quality,\n\
    \    outline contours and perform sketch-like renderings are provided\n  * Visualization
    of residues (ribbon or schematic)\n  * Complete control over the generation of
    molecular surfaces (bounding\n    box and resolution)\n  * Visualization of the
    following surfaces:\n    - Orbitals\n    - Iso-surface from density matrix\n \
    \   - Iso-surface from Gaussian cube grid data\n    - SAS\n    - SES\n    - Van
    der Waals\n  * Animation of molecular surfaces\n  * Animation of vibrational modes\n\
    \  * Export high resolution images for 300+ DPI printing\n  * Export to PostScript
    and PDF\n  * Export animation\n  * Plane widget to visualize a scalar field: the
    plane can be freely\n    moved in 3d space and the points on the plane surface
    will be colored\n    according to the value of the scalar field: a cursor can
    be moved on\n    the plane surface to show the exact value of the field at a specific\n\
    \    point in space."
