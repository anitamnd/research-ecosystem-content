  description: java wrapper for reading whole slide image files
  long_description: " OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to
    read whole-slide\n images also known as virtual slides.\n .\n Whole-slide images,
    also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution\n images used in digital
    pathology. Reading these images using standard image\n tools or libraries is a
    challenge because these tools are typically designed\n for images that can comfortably
    be uncompressed into RAM or a swap file.\n Whole-slide images routinely exceed
    RAM sizes, often occupying tens of\n gigabytes when uncompressed. Additionally,
    whole-slide images are typically\n multi-resolution, and only a small amount of
    image data might be needed at a\n particular resolution.\n .\n This library currently
    supports:\n  * Trestle (.tif)\n  * Hamamatsu (.vms, .vmu)\n  * Aperio (.svs, .tif)\n\
    \  * MIRAX (.mrxs)\n  * Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)\n .\n This package contains
    the java module needed to run OpenSlide applications."
