  description: command line program for finding patterns in nucleic acids
  long_description: " tacg is a character-based, command line tool for unix-like operating
    systems\n for pattern-matching in nucleic acids and performing some of the basic
    protein\n manipulations. It was originally designed for restriction enzyme analysis
    of\n DNA, but has been extended to other types of matching. It now handles\n degenerate
    sequence input in a variety of matching approaches, as well as\n patterns with
    errors, regular expressions and TRANSFAC-formatted matrices.\n .\n It was designed
    to be a grep for DNA and like the original grep, its\n capabilities have grown
    so that now the author has to keep calling up the help\n page to figure out which
    flags (now ~50) mean what. tacg is NOT a GUI\n application in any sense. However,
    it's existance as a strictly command-line\n tool lends itself well to Webification
    and wrapping by various GUI tools and\n it is now distributed with a web interface
    form and a Perl CGI handler.\n Additionally, it can easily be integrated into
    editors that support shell\n commands such as nedit."
