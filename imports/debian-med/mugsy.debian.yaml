  description: multiple whole genome alignment tool
  long_description: " Mugsy is a multiple whole genome aligner. Mugsy uses Nucmer
    for\n pairwise alignment, a custom graph based segmentation procedure for\n identifying
    collinear regions, and the segment-based progressive\n multiple alignment strategy
    from Seqan::TCoffee. Mugsy accepts draft\n genomes in the form of multi-FASTA
    files and does not require a\n reference genome."
