about:
  description: 'A complete toolset for methylome-wide association studies (MWAS).
    It is specifically designed for data from enrichment based methylation assays,
    but can be applied to other data as well. The analysis pipeline includes seven
    steps: (1) scanning aligned reads from BAM files, (2) calculation of quality control
    measures, (3) creation of methylation score (coverage) matrix, (4) principal component
    analysis for capturing batch effects and detection of outliers, (5) association
    analysis with respect to phenotypes of interest while correcting for top PCs and
    known covariates, (6) annotation of significant findings, and (7) multi-marker
    analysis (methylation risk score) using elastic net. Additionally, RaMWAS include
    tools for joint analysis of methlyation and genotype data. This work is published
    in Bioinformatics, Shabalin et al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty069>.'
