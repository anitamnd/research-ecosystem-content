about:
  description: '''rifi'' analyses data from rifampicin time series created by microarray
    or RNAseq. ''rifi'' is a transcriptome data analysis tool for the holistic identification
    of transcription and decay associated processes. The decay constants and the delay
    of the onset of decay is fitted for each probe/bin. Subsequently, probes/bins
    of equal properties are combined into segments by dynamic programming, independent
    of a existing genome annotation. This allows to detect transcript segments of
    different stability or transcriptional events within one annotated gene. In addition
    to the classic decay constant/half-life analysis, ''rifi'' detects processing
    sites, transcription pausing sites, internal transcription start sites in operons,
    sites of partial transcription termination in operons, identifies areas of likely
    transcriptional interference by the collision mechanism and gives an estimate
    of the transcription velocity. All data are integrated to give an estimate of
    continous transcriptional units, i.e. operons. Comprehensive output tables and
    visualizations of the full genome result and the individual fits for all probes/bins
    are produced.'
