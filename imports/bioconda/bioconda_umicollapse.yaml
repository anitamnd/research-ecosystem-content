about:
  description: UMIs are a popular way to identify duplicate DNA/RNA reads caused by
    PCR amplification. This requires software for collapsing duplicate reads with
    the same UMI, while accounting for sequencing/PCR errors. This tool implements
    many efficient algorithms for orders-of-magnitude faster UMI deduplication than
    previous tools (UMI-tools, etc.), while maintaining similar functionality. This
    is achieved by using faster data structures with n-grams and BK-trees, along other
    techniques that are carefully implemented to scale well to larger datasets and
    longer UMIs. Users of UMICollapse have reported speedups from taking hours or
    days to run with a previous tool to taking only a few minutes with this tool with
    real datasets! doi 10.7717/peerj.8275.
