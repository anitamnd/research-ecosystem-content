about:
  description: The rmspc package runs MSPC (Multiple Sample Peak Calling) software
    using R. The analysis of ChIP-seq samples outputs a number of enriched regions
    (commonly known as "peaks"), each indicating a protein-DNA interaction or a specific
    chromatin modification. When replicate samples are analyzed, overlapping peaks
    are expected. This repeated evidence can therefore be used to locally lower the
    minimum significance required to accept a peak. MSPC uses combined evidence from
    replicated experiments to evaluate peak calling output, rescuing peaks, and reduce
    false positives. It takes any number of replicates as input and improves sensitivity
    and specificity of peak calling on each, and identifies consensus regions between
    the input samples.
