about:
  description: "A novel clustering algorithm and toolkit RCSL (Rank Constrained Similarity\
    \ Learning) to accurately identify various cell types using scRNA-seq data from\
    \ a complex tissue. RCSL considers both lo-cal similarity and global similarity\
    \ among the cells to discern the subtle differences among cells of the same type\
    \ as well as larger differences among cells of different types. RCSL uses Spearman\u2019\
    s rank correlations of a cell\u2019s expression vector with those of other cells\
    \ to measure its global similar-ity, and adaptively learns neighbour representation\
    \ of a cell as its local similarity. The overall similar-ity of a cell to other\
    \ cells is a linear combination of its global similarity and local similarity."
