about:
  description: KnowSeq proposes a novel methodology that comprises the most relevant
    steps in the Transcriptomic gene expression analysis. KnowSeq expects to serve
    as an integrative tool that allows to process and extract relevant biomarkers,
    as well as to assess them through a Machine Learning approaches. Finally, the
    last objective of KnowSeq is the biological knowledge extraction from the biomarkers
    (Gene Ontology enrichment, Pathway listing and Visualization and Evidences related
    to the addressed disease). Although the package allows analyzing all the data
    manually, the main strenght of KnowSeq is the possibilty of carrying out an automatic
    and intelligent HTML report that collect all the involved steps in one document.
    It is important to highligh that the pipeline is totally modular and flexible,
    hence it can be started from whichever of the different steps. KnowSeq expects
    to serve as a novel tool to help to the experts in the field to acquire robust
    knowledge and conclusions for the data and diseases to study.
