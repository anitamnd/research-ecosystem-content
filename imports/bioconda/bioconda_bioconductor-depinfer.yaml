  description: "DepInfeR integrates two experimentally accessible input data matrices:\
    \ the drug sensitivity profiles of cancer cell lines or primary tumors ex-vivo\
    \ (X), and the drug affinities of a set of proteins (Y), to infer a matrix of\
    \ molecular protein dependencies of the cancers (\xDF). DepInfeR deconvolutes\
    \ the protein inhibition effect on the viability phenotype by using regularized\
    \ multivariate linear regression. It assigns a \u201Cdependence coefficient\u201D\
    \ to each protein and each sample, and therefore could be used to gain a causal\
    \ and accurate understanding of functional consequences of genomic aberrations\
    \ in a heterogeneous disease, as well as to guide the choice of pharmacological\
    \ intervention for a specific cancer type, sub-type, or an individual patient.\
