about:
  description: "KEGGCharter takes as input a quantification table of proteins with\
    \ corresponding\nKEGG IDs available and maps that information into KEGG metabolic\
    \ maps using \nthe KEGG API. Both genomic potential (from either genomics or metagenomics)\n\
    and gene expression quantification (from either (meta)transcriptomics or\n(meta)proteomics)\
    \ can be represented. Genomic information is mapped in a binary\nexists or not\
    \ rule, for each taxon available KEGGCharter will assign a color\nwhich will be\
    \ included in the boxes corresponding to functions present in that\ntaxon. Gene\
    \ expression quantification is mapped as differential expression\nwhere quantification\
    \ between the several columns specified is represented as\na single row heatmap\
    \ for each function present in the data.\n"
