about:
  description: 'Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and
    public health potential of pathogen genome data.  It includes a collection of
    open-source tools to aid in our understanding of pathogen spread and evolution,
    especially in outbreak scenarios.  These tools are designed to be used with a
    wide range of data sources and designed to be modular so they can be replaced
    with your own tooling when necessary.
