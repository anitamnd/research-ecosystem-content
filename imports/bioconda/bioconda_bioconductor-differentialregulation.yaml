about:
  description: 'DifferentialRegulation is a method for detecting differentially regulated
    genes between two groups of samples (e.g., healthy vs. disease, or treated vs.
    untreated samples), by targeting differences in the balance of spliced and unspliced
    mRNA abundances, obtained from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. From
    a mathematical point of view, DifferentialRegulation accounts for the sample-to-sample
    variability, and embeds multiple samples in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Furthermore,
    our method also deals with two major sources of mapping uncertainty: i) ''ambiguous''
    reads, compatible with both spliced and unspliced versions of a gene, and ii)
    reads mapping to multiple genes. In particular, ambiguous reads are treated separately
    from spliced and unsplced reads, while reads that are compatible with multiple
    genes are allocated to the gene of origin. Parameters are inferred via Markov
    chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques (Metropolis-within-Gibbs).'
