  summary: Sprai (single-pass read accuracy improver) is a tool to correct sequencing
    errors in single-pass reads for de novo assembly. It is originally designed for
    correcting sequencing errors in single-molecule DNA sequencing reads, especially
    in Continuous Long Reads (CLRs) generated by PacBio RS sequencers. The goal of
    Sprai is not maximizing the accuracy of error-corrected reads; instead, Sprai
    aims at maximizing the continuity (i.e., N50 contig length) of assembled contigs
    after error correction.
