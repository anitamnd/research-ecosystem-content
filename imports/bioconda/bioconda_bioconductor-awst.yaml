about:
  description: 'We propose an Asymmetric Within-Sample Transformation (AWST) to regularize
    RNA-seq read counts and reduce the effect of noise on the classification of samples.
    AWST comprises two main steps: standardization and smoothing. These steps transform
    gene expression data to reduce the noise of the lowly expressed features, which
    suffer from background effects and low signal-to-noise ratio, and the influence
    of the highly expressed features, which may be the result of amplification bias
    and other experimental artifacts.'
