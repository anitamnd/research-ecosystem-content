about:
  description: 'NoTrAmp is a Tool for super fast trimming and read-depth normalization
    of amplicon reads. It is designed to be used in amplicon-tiling panels (or similar
    multiplexed amplicon sequencing approaches) to cap coverage of each amplicon (if
    desired) and to trim amplicons to their appropriate length removing barcodes,
    adpaters and primers (if desired) in a single clipping step.


    NoTrAmp is suitable for use with both long (e.g. ONT/PacBio) and short reads (e.g
    Illumina). When using reads that are significantly shorter than amplicon sizes,
    you should adjust the minimum required alignment length using the --set_min_len
    argument.


    See the projects [home](https://github.com/simakro/NoTrAmp) for usage and additional
    documentation.'
