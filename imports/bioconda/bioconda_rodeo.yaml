  summary: RODEO evaluates one or many genes, characterizing a gene neighborhood based
    on the presence of profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs). Because RiPP precursor
    peptides are small and often evade annotation in sequence databases, RODEO can
    also manually translate small ORFs (open reading frames). A combination of support
    vector machine (SVM) learning and motif analysis can be used to scan unannotated
    intergenic regions for RiPP precursors.
