  description: Statistical methods for multiple testing with covariate information.
    Traditional multiple testing methods only consider a list of test statistics,
    such as p-values. Our methods incorporate the auxiliary information, such as the
    lengths of gene coding regions or the minor allele frequencies of SNPs, to improve
    power.
