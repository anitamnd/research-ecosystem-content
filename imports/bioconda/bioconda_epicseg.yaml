  summary: EpiCSeg (Epigenome Count-based Segmentation) is a software for annotating
    the genome based on the state of the chromatin. It provides tools for extracting
    count data from BAM files, typlically corresponding to ChIP-seq experiments for
    histone marks (but other choices are possible) it learns a statistical model for
    the read counts based on a HMM, it annotates the genome, and it provides tools
    for displaying and analyzing the obtained models and segmentations. EpiCSeg can
    be used as an R package or from the command line via Rscript.
