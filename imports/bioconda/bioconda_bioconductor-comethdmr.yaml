about:
  description: coMethDMR identifies genomic regions associated with continuous phenotypes
    by optimally leverages covariations among CpGs within predefined genomic regions.
    Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region, coMethDMR carries out an
    additional step that selects co-methylated sub-regions first without using any
    outcome information. Next, coMethDMR tests association between methylation within
    the sub-region and continuous phenotype using a random coefficient mixed effects
    model, which models both variations between CpG sites within the region and differential
    methylation simultaneously.
