  description: "MS-based shotgun proteomics estimates protein abundances using a proxy:\
    \ peptides. \nDue to the acquisition method for MS2, not every peptide ion present\
    \ can be identified in every run. One approach to mitigate this problem is to\
    \ \nalign information obtained from similar runs to the current run, therefore\
    \ getting more quantifications. This tool scores the quantifications \nobtained\
    \ through alignment based on peak and run properties to obtain a measurement of\
    \ reliability for the alignments.\n"
