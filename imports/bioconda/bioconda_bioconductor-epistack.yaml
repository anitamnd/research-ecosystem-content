about:
  description: 'The epistack package main objective is the visualizations of stacks
    of genomic tracks (such as, but not restricted to, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNA methyation
    or genomic conservation data) centered at genomic regions of interest. epistack
    needs three different inputs: 1) a genomic score objects, such as ChIP-seq coverage
    or DNA methylation values, provided as a `GRanges` (easily obtained from `bigwig`
    or `bam` files). 2) a list of feature of interest, such as peaks or transcription
    start sites, provided as a `GRanges` (easily obtained from `gtf` or `bed` files).
    3) a score to sort the features, such as peak height or gene expression value.'
