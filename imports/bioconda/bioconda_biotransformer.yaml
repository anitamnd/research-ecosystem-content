  description: 'BioTransformer is a software tool that predicts small molecule metabolism
    in mammals, their gut microbiota,

    as well as the soil/aquatic microbiota. BioTransformer also assists scientists
    in metabolite identification,

    based on the metabolism prediction.

  notes: 'Biotransformer is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper python script.

    This python wrapper is called "biotransformer" and is on $PATH by default. By
    default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "biotransformer -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
