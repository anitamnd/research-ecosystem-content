about:
  description: A fundamental problem in biomedical research is the low number of observations,
    mostly due to a lack of available biosamples, prohibitive costs, or ethical reasons.
    By augmenting a few real observations with artificially generated samples, their
    analysis could lead to more robust and higher reproducible. One possible solution
    to the problem is the use of generative models, which are statistical models of
    data that attempt to capture the entire probability distribution from the observations.
    Using the variational autoencoder (VAE), a well-known deep generative model, this
    package is aimed to generate samples with gene expression data, especially for
    single-cell RNA-seq data. Furthermore, the VAE can use conditioning to produce
    specific cell types or subpopulations. The conditional VAE (CVAE) allows us to
    create targeted samples rather than completely random ones.
