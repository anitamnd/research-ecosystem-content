  description: "Given a FASTA file with a multiple sequence alignment of nucleotides,\n\
    this tool counts the sites in the alignment that are constant. The \noutput is\
    \ a line suitable for use in IQTREE's `-fconst`, thus 4 numbers\nwith commas expressing\
    \ the count of As, Cs, Gs and Ts.\n"
