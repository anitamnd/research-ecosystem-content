  description: 'Curare is a freely available analysis pipeline for reproducible, high-throughput,

    bacterial RNA-Seq experiments. Define standardized pipelines customized for your

    specific workflow without the necessity of installing all the tools by yourself.

    Curare is implemented in Python and uses the power of Snakemake and Conda to build

    and execute the defined workflows. Its modulized structure and the simplicity
    of

    Snakemake enables developers to create new and advanced workflow steps.'
