about:
  description: Precompiled and processed miRNA-overexpression fold-changes from 84
    Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) series corresponding to 6 platforms, 77 human cells
    or tissues, and 113 distinct miRNAs. Accompanied with the data, we also included
    in this package the sequence feature scores from TargetScanHuman 6.1 including
    the context+ score and the probabilities of conserved targeting for each miRNA-mRNA
    interaction. Thus, the user can use these static sequence-based scores together
    with user-supplied tissue/cell-specific fold-change due to miRNA overexpression
    to predict miRNA targets using the package TargetScore (download separately)
