  notes: 'This wrapper and installation is primarily for commandline use.

    Set JALVIEW_JRE=j1.8 or JALVIEW_JRE=j11 to specify the java runtime if you need
    jalview to start up as quickly as possible

    Set JALVIEW_MAXMEM=2g to restrict jalviews maximal memory consumption (here to
    2G RAM). Otherwise 90% of physical memory

    (capped at 32G) is allocated.  Memory allocation can also be set in Tools->Preferences->Startup
    or specified with command-

    line arguments --jvmmempc=90 (percentage of total physical memory, default 90)
    and --jvmmemmax=2g (set a different cap,

    default 32G if total physical memory can be detected or 8G if total physical memory
    cannot be detected).'
