about:
  description: MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules are cell surface complexes
    that present antigens to T cells.  The repertoire of antigens presented in a given
    genetic background largely depends on the sequence of the encoded MHC molecules,
    and thus, in humans, on the highly variable HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes
    of the hyperpolymorphic HLA locus. More than 28,000 different HLA alleles have
    been reported, with significant differences in allele frequencies between human
    populations worldwide. Reproducible and consistent annotation of HLA alleles in
    large-scale bioinformatics workflows remains challenging, because the available
    reference databases and software tools often use different HLA naming schemes.
    The package immunotation provides tools for consistent annotation of HLA genes
    in typical immunoinformatics workflows such as for example the prediction of MHC-presented
    peptides in different human donors. Converter functions that provide mappings
    between different HLA naming schemes are based on the MHC restriction ontology
    (MRO). The package also provides automated access to HLA alleles frequencies in
    worldwide human reference populations stored in the Allele Frequency Net Database.
