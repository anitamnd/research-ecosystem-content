about:
  description: GOThresher removes annotation bias from GAF files based on GO term
    information content, GO evidence, annotation source, number of proteins annotated
    from a given source, and date. GOThresher accepts one or more GAF files as input.
    The motivation for GOThresher lies in the observation that protein function annotations
    are biased due to high throughput experimental studies. Removing such annotation
    biases can help present a more balanced picture of protein annotations for a given
    organism or set of proteins.
