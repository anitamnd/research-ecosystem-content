about:
  description: A pipeline that uses ribosome profiling data for a de novo open reading
    frame delineation in prokaryotic (bacterial) genomes. I changed the original reparation
    project to use the open-source blast tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
    instead of the commercial usearch --ublast tool (https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/ublast_algo.html).
    I did this in order to add this tool to bioconda without having licensing issues
    with the commercial usearch -ublast tool. The original software was created at
    VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology and Lab of Bioinformatics and Computational
    Genomics (Biobix), University of Gent, Belgium, by Elvis Ndah. (https://github.com/Biobix/REPARATION).
    Be advised that the adapted version has slightly different results and is slower
    than the original reparation software.
