about:
  description: The biodbKegg library is an extension of the biodb framework package
    that provides access to the KEGG databases Compound, Enzyme, Genes, Module, Orthology
    and Reaction. It allows to retrieve entries by their accession numbers. Web services
    like "find", "list" and "findExactMass" are also available. Some functions for
    navigating along the pathways have also been implemented.
