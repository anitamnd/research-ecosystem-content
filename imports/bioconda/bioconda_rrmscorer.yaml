  description: "RRMScorer (RRM-RNA score predictor) allows the user to easily predict\n\
    how likely a single RRM is to bind ssRNA using a carefully generated\nalignment\
    \ for the RRM structures in complex with RNA, from which we\nanalyzed the interaction\
    \ patterns and derived the scores (please\naddress to the publication for more\
    \ details on the method REF).\n\nRRMScorer has several features to either calculate\
    \ the binding score\nfor a specific RRM and RNA sequences, for a set of RRM sequences\
    \ in a\nFASTA file, or to explore which are the best RNA binders according to\
    \ our scoring method.\n\nRRMScorer has been developed by Bio2Byte within the RNAct\
    \ project. This project has received\nfunding from the European Union's Horizon\
    \ 2020 research and innovation programme under\nthe Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie\
    \ grant agreement No. 813239.\n\nWim Vranken, Bio2Byte group within the RNAct\
