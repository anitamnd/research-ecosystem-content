about:
  description: "mitch is an R package for multi-contrast enrichment analysis. At it\u2019\
    s heart, it uses a rank-MANOVA based statistical approach to detect sets of genes\
    \ that exhibit enrichment in the multidimensional space as compared to the background.\
    \ The rank-MANOVA concept dates to work by Cox and Mann (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-13-S16-S12).\
    \ mitch is useful for pathway analysis of profiling studies with one, two or more\
    \ contrasts, or in studies with multiple omics profiling, for example proteomic,\
    \ transcriptomic, epigenomic analysis of the same samples. mitch is perfectly\
    \ suited for pathway level differential analysis of scRNA-seq data. The main strengths\
    \ of mitch are that it can import datasets easily from many upstream tools and\
    \ has advanced plotting features to visualise these enrichments."
