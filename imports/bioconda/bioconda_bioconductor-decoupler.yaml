about:
  description: Many methods allow us to extract biological activities from omics data
    using information from prior knowledge resources, reducing the dimensionality
    for increased statistical power and better interpretability. Here, we present
    decoupleR, a Bioconductor package containing different statistical methods to
    extract these signatures within a unified framework. decoupleR allows the user
    to flexibly test any method with any resource. It incorporates methods that take
    into account the sign and weight of network interactions. decoupleR can be used
    with any omic, as long as its features can be linked to a biological process based
    on prior knowledge. For example, in transcriptomics gene sets regulated by a transcription
    factor, or in phospho-proteomics phosphosites that are targeted by a kinase.
