about:
  description: hoodscanR is an user-friendly R package providing functions to assist
    cellular neighborhood analysis of any spatial transcriptomics data with single-cell
    resolution. All functions in the package are built based on the SpatialExperiment
    object, allowing integration into various spatial transcriptomics-related packages
    from Bioconductor. The package can result in cell-level neighborhood annotation
    output, along with funtions to perform neighborhood colocalization analysis and
    neighborhood-based cell clustering.
