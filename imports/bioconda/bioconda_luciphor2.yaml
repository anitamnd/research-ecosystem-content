  notes: 'Adds a wrapper shell script "luciphor2".

    This shell wrapper is called "luciphor2" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run with "luciphor -Xms512m -Xmx1g"'
