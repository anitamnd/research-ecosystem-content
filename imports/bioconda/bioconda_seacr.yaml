  summary: SEACR is intended to call peaks and enriched regions from sparse CUT&RUN
    or chromatin profiling data in which background is dominated by "zeroes" (i.e.
    regions with no read coverage). It requires R (https://www.r-project.org) and
    Bedtools (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to be available in your
    path, and it requires bedgraphs from paired-end sequencing as input, which can
    be generated from read pair BED files (i.e. BED coordinates reflecting the 5'
    and 3' termini of each read pair) using bedtools genomecov with the "-bg" flag,
    or alternatively from name-sorted paired-end BAM files as described in "Preparing
    input bedgraph files" below.
