about:
  description: The ZygosityPredictor allows to predict how many copies of a gene are
    affected by small variants. In addition to the basic calculations of the affected
    copy number of a variant, the Zygosity-Predictor can integrate the influence of
    several variants on a gene and ultimately make a statement if and how many wild-type
    copies of the gene are left. This information proves to be of particular use in
    the context of translational medicine. For example, in cancer genomes, the Zygosity-Predictor
    can address whether unmutated copies of tumor-suppressor genes are present. Beyond
    this, it is possible to make this statement for all genes of an organism. The
    Zygosity-Predictor was primarily developed to handle SNVs and INDELs (later addressed
    as small-variants) of somatic and germline origin. In order not to overlook severe
    effects outside of the small-variant context, it has been extended with the assessment
    of large scale deletions, which cause losses of whole genes or parts of them.
