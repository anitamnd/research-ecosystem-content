  description: In gene therapy, stem cells are modified using viral vectors to deliver
    the therapeutic transgene and replace functional properties since the genetic
    modification is stable and inherited in all cell progeny. The retrieval and mapping
    of the sequences flanking the virus-host DNA junctions allows the identification
    of insertion sites (IS), essential for monitoring the evolution of genetically
    modified cells in vivo. A comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of IS is required
    to foster clonal trackign studies and supporting the assessment of safety and
    long term efficacy in vivo. This package is aimed at (1) supporting automation
    of IS workflow, (2) performing base and advance analysis for IS tracking (clonal
    abundance, clonal expansions and statistics for insertional mutagenesis, etc.),
    (3) providing basic biology insights of transduced stem cells in vivo.
