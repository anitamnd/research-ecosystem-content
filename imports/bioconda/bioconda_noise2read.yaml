about:
  description: 'noise2read, originated in a computable rule translated from PCR erring
    mechanism that: a rare read is erroneous if it has a neighboring read of high
    abundance, turns erroneous reads into their original state without bringing up
    any non-existing sequences into the short read set(&lt 300bp) including DNA and
    RNA sequencing (DNA/RNA-seq), small RNA, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and
    amplicon sequencing data.
