about:
  description: "After quantification and protein inference are performed, it is known\
    \ which peptide originated from which protein, as well as the intensity of each\
    \ peptide. \nThe information available for each peptide now needs to be aggragated\
    \ for their proteins.\nThis tool performs the aggregation from the peptides to\
    \ the protein in several steps. The first two aggregation steps are optional.\
    \ One of them is the \naggregation based on charge state. Peptides with the same\
    \ sequence and modifications, but different charge states are being aggregated.\
    \ The next optional step \ndoes the same for peptides with the same sequence,\
    \ but different modifications. Those steps build upon each other. The last step\
    \ is the aggregation of all \npeptides of a protein. The result of each aggregation\
    \ step is given as a tab separated file. The aggregation is performed according\
    \ to the given parameters for \neach step. If an optional aggregation is not performed,\
    \ the next step takes the result from the prior aggregation. For example, if aggregation\
    \ by charge and \nmodification are skipped, the protein aggregation is performed\
    \ on previously unaggregated peptides, where a peptidesequence can occur with\
    \ different charge \nstates and modifications.\n"
