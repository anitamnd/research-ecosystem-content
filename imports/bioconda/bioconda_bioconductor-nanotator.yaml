  description: "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has successfully been used to identify\
    \ single-nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and,\
    \ more recently, small copy number variants (CNVs). However, due to utilization\
    \ of short reads, it is not well suited for identification of structural variants\
    \ (SV). Optical mapping (OM) from Bionano Genomics, utilizes long fluorescently\
    \ labeled megabase size DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly and identification\
    \ of SVs with a much higher sensitivity than WGS. Nevertheless, currently available\
    \ SV annotation tools have limited number of functions. NanotatoR is an R package\
    \ written to provide a set of annotations for SVs identified by OM. It uses Database\
    \ of Genomic Variants (DGV), Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in\
    \ Humans Using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER) as well as a subset (154 samples)\
    \ of 1000 Genome Project to calculate the population frequencies of the SVs (an\
    \ optional internal cohort SV frequency calculation is also available). NanotatoR\
    \ creates a primary gene list (PG) from NCBI databases based on proband\u2019\
    s phenotype specific keywords and compares the list to the set of genes overlapping/near\
    \ SVs. The output is given in an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple\
    \ sheets based on SV type (e.g., INDELs, Inversions, Translocations). Users then\
    \ have a choice to filter SVs using the provided annotations for de novo (if parental\
    \ samples are available) or inherited rare variants."
