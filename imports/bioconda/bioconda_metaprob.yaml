  description: 'MetaProb is a novel assembly-assisted tool for un-supervised metagenomic

    binning. The novelty of MetaProb derives from solving a few important

    problems: how to divide reads into groups of independent reads, so that

    l-mer frequencies are not overestimated; how to convert l-mer counts into

    probabilistic sequence signatures, that will correct for variable

    distribution of l-mers, and for unbalanced groups of reads, in order to

    produce better estimates of the underlying genome statistic. We show that

    MetaProb is effective for both simulated and real datasets. It can

    accurately (with F-measures of 87 for short reads and 97 long reads) and

    efficiently bin short and long reads with varying abundance ratios.
