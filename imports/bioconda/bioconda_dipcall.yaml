about:
  description: 'Dipcall is a reference-based variant calling pipeline for a pair of
    phased haplotype assemblies. It was originally developed for constructing the
    syndip benchmark dataset and has been applied to other phased assemblies, too.
    Dipcall can call small variants and long INDELs as long as they are contained
    in minimap2 alignment.
