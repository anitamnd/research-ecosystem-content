about:
  description: The 'phenomis' package provides methods to perform post-processing
    (i.e. quality control and normalization) as well as univariate statistical analysis
    of single and multi-omics data sets. These methods include quality control metrics,
    signal drift and batch effect correction, intensity transformation, univariate
    hypothesis testing, but also clustering (as well as annotation of metabolomics
    data). The data are handled in the standard Bioconductor formats (i.e. SummarizedExperiment
    and MultiAssayExperiment for single and multi-omics datasets, respectively; the
    alternative ExpressionSet and MultiDataSet formats are also supported for convenience).
    As a result, all methods can be readily chained as workflows. The pipeline can
    be further enriched by multivariate analysis and feature selection, by using the
    'ropls' and 'biosigner' packages, which support the same formats. Data can be
    conveniently imported from and exported to text files. Although the methods were
    initially targeted to metabolomics data, most of the methods can be applied to
    other types of omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics).
