about:
  description: This package provides a novel feature selection algorithm for binary
    classification using support vector machine recursive feature elimination SVM-RFE
    and t-statistic. In this feature selection process, the selected features are
    differentially significant between the two classes and also they are good classifier
    with higher degree of classification accuracy.
