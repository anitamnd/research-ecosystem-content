  description: With the development of high-throughput techniques, more and more gene
    expression analysis tend to replace hybridization-based microarrays with the revolutionary
    technology.The novel method encodes the category again by employing the rank of
    samples for each gene in each class. We then consider the correlation coefficient
    of gene and class with rank of sample and new rank of category. The highest correlation
    coefficient genes are considered as the feature genes which are most effective
    to classify the samples.
