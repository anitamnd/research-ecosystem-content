about:
  description: "An extensive set of data (pre-)processing and analysis methods and\
    \ tools for metabolomics and other omics, with a strong emphasis on statistics\
    \ and machine learning. This toolbox allows the user to build extensive and standardised\
    \ workflows for data analysis. The methods and tools have been implemented using\
    \ class-based templates provided by the struct (Statistics in R Using Class-based\
    \ Templates) package. The toolbox includes pre-processing methods (e.g. signal\
    \ drift and batch correction, normalisation, missing value imputation and scaling),\
    \ univariate (e.g. ttest, various forms of ANOVA, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and\
    \ more) and multivariate statistical methods (e.g. PCA and PLS, including cross-validation\
    \ and permutation testing) as well as machine learning methods (e.g. Support Vector\
    \ Machines). The STATistics Ontology (STATO) has been integrated and implemented\
    \ to provide standardised definitions for the different methods, inputs and outputs."
