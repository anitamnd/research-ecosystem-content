about:
  description: DoRothEA is a gene regulatory network containing signed transcription
    factor (TF) - target gene interactions. DoRothEA regulons, the collection of a
    TF and its transcriptional targets, were curated and collected from different
    types of evidence for both human and mouse. A confidence level was assigned to
    each TF-target interaction based on the number of supporting evidence.
