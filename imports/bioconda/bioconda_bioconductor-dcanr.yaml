about:
  description: This package implements methods and an evaluation framework to infer
    differential co-expression/association networks. Various methods are implemented
    and can be evaluated using simulated datasets. Inference of differential co-expression
    networks can allow identification of networks that are altered between two conditions
    (e.g., health and disease).
