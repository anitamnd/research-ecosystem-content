  description: "COLOMBO is a software framework equipped with a GUI for the prediction\
    \ of genomic islands (GIs) in prokaryotes. It can be equipped with different plugins\
    \ that actually perform the prediction. \nThe current version of COLOMBO is supplied\
    \ with\n\nSIGI-HMM that uses hidden Markov models and codon usage bias;\n\nSIGi-CRF\
    \ utilizing conditional random fields and tetramer-based order-3 Markov chain\
    \ transition probabilities. In particular, SIGI-CRF analyzes non-annotated genomic\
    \ sequences.\n\nhttps://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-142\n\
    \nSIGI_CRF-AUTO\n\nSIGI_CRF-AUTO is an alternative front-end to the SIGI-CRF processing\
    \ core. First, it allows to batch process a large number of genome sequences and/or\
    \ to run a variety of parameter combinations. \nSecond, it can collect all individual\
    \ prediction results generated by varying parameter combinations and combine them\
    \ into a single graphical representation. Once rendered, images can be saved very\
    \ \nflexible with a broad variety of format options."
