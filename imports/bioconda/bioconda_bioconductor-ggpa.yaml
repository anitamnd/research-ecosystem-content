about:
  description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a widely used tool for identification
    of genetic variants associated with phenotypes and diseases, though complex diseases
    featuring many genetic variants with small effects present difficulties for traditional
    these studies. By leveraging pleiotropy, the statistical power of a single GWAS
    can be increased. This package provides functions for fitting graph-GPA, a statistical
    framework to prioritize GWAS results by integrating pleiotropy. 'GGPA' package
    provides user-friendly interface to fit graph-GPA models, implement association
    mapping, and generate a phenotype graph.
