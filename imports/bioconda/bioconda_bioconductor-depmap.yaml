about:
  description: The depmap package is a data package that accesses datsets from the
    Broad Institute DepMap cancer dependency study using ExperimentHub. Datasets from
    the most current release are available, including RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout
    screens quantifying the genetic dependency for select cancer cell lines. Additional
    datasets are also available pertaining to the log copy number of genes for select
    cell lines, protein expression of cell lines as measured by reverse phase protein
    lysate microarray (RPPA), 'Transcript Per Million' (TPM) data, as well as supplementary
    datasets which contain metadata and mutation calls for the other datasets found
    in the current release. The 19Q3 release adds the drug_dependency dataset, that
    contains cancer cell line dependency data with respect to drug and drug-candidate
    compounds. The 20Q2 release adds the proteomic dataset that contains quantitative
    profiling of proteins via mass spectrometry. This package will be updated on a
    quarterly basis to incorporate the latest Broad Institute DepMap Public cancer
    dependency datasets. All data made available in this package was generated by
    the Broad Institute DepMap for research purposes and not intended for clinical
    use. This data is distributed under the Creative Commons license (Attribution
