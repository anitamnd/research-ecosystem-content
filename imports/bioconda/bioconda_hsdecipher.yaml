  description: Many tools have been developed to measure the degree of similarity
    between gene duplicates within and between species.Here, we present HSDecipher,
    a bioinformatics pipeline to assist users in the analysis and visualization of
    highly similar duplicate genes (HSDs). We describe the steps for analysis of HSDs
    statistics, expanding HSD gene set, and visualizing the results of comparative
    genomic analyses. HSDecipher represents a useful tool for researchers exploring
    the evolution of duplicate genes in select eukaryotic species.
