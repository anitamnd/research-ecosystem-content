about:
  description: This package provides functionality for performing divergence analysis
    as presented in Dinalankara et al, "Digitizing omics profiles by divergence from
    a baseline", PANS 2018. This allows the user to simplify high dimensional omics
    data into a binary or ternary format which encapsulates how the data is divergent
    from a specified baseline group with the same univariate or multivariate features.
