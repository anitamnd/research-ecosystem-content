  summary: "SNVer is a statistical tool for calling common and rare variants in analysis\
    \ of pool or individual next-generation sequencing data.\nIt reports one single\
    \ overall p-value for evaluating the significance of a candidate locus being a\
    \ variant, based on which multiplicity control can be obtained.\nLoci with any\
    \ (low) coverage can be tested and depth of coverage will be quantitatively factored\
    \ into final significance calculation.\nSNVer runs very fast, making it feasible\
    \ for analysis of whole-exome sequencing data, or even whole-genome sequencing\
    \ data. \n"

  notes: 'SNVer is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "snver -Xms512m -Xmx1g"'
