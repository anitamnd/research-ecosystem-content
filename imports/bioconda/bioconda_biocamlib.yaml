about:
  description: 'BiOCamLib is an OCaml foundation upon which a number of the bioinformatics
    tools are built,

    including KPop <https://github.com/PaoloRibeca/KPop>. It consists of four tools:

    1. RC, which can efficiently compute the reverse complement of sequences.

    2. Octopus, which is a high-throughput program to compute the transitive closure
    of strings.

    3. Parallel, which allows the splits and processes an input file chunk-wise using
    a reader/workers/writer model.

    4. FASTools, which is a Swiss-knife tool for the manipulation of FASTA/FASTQ files.
