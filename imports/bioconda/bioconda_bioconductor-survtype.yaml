about:
  description: Subtypes are defined as groups of samples that have distinct molecular
    and clinical features. Genomic data can be analyzed for discovering patient subtypes,
    associated with clinical data, especially for survival information. This package
    is aimed to identify subtypes that are both clinically relevant and biologically
    meaningful.
