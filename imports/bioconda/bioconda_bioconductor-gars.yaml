  description: 'Feature selection aims to identify and remove redundant, irrelevant
    and noisy variables from high-dimensional datasets. Selecting informative features
    affects the subsequent classification and regression analyses by improving their
    overall performances. Several methods have been proposed to perform feature selection:
    most of them relies on univariate statistics, correlation, entropy measurements
    or the usage of backward/forward regressions. Herein, we propose an efficient,
    robust and fast method that adopts stochastic optimization approaches for high-dimensional.
    GARS is an innovative implementation of a genetic algorithm that selects robust
    features in high-dimensional and challenging datasets.'
