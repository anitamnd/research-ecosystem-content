about:
  description: SCATE is a software tool for extracting and enhancing the sparse and
    discrete Single-cell ATAC-seq Signal. Single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible
    chromatin (scATAC-seq) is the state-of-the-art technology for analyzing genome-wide
    regulatory landscapes in single cells. Single-cell ATAC-seq data are sparse and
    noisy, and analyzing such data is challenging. Existing computational methods
    cannot accurately reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements
    (CREs) in individual cells or rare cell subpopulations. SCATE was developed to
    adaptively integrate information from co-activated CREs, similar cells, and publicly
    available regulome data and substantially increase the accuracy for estimating
    activities of individual CREs. We demonstrate that SCATE can be used to better
    reconstruct the regulatory landscape of a heterogeneous sample.
