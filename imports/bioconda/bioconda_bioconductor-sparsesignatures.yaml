about:
  description: Point mutations occurring in a genome can be divided into 96 categories
    based on the base being mutated, the base it is mutated into and its two flanking
    bases. Therefore, for any patient, it is possible to represent all the point mutations
    occurring in that patient's tumor as a vector of length 96, where each element
    represents the count of mutations for a given category in the patient. A mutational
    signature represents the pattern of mutations produced by a mutagen or mutagenic
    process inside the cell. Each signature can also be represented by a vector of
    length 96, where each element represents the probability that this particular
    mutagenic process generates a mutation of the 96 above mentioned categories. In
    this R package, we provide a set of functions to extract and visualize the mutational
    signatures that best explain the mutation counts of a large number of patients.
