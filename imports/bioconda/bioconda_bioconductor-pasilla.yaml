about:
  description: 'This package provides per-exon and per-gene read counts computed for
    selected genes from RNA-seq data that were presented in the article "Conservation
    of an RNA regulatory map between Drosophila and mammals" by Brooks AN, Yang L,
    Duff MO, Hansen KD, Park JW, Dudoit S, Brenner SE, Graveley BR, Genome Res. 2011
    Feb;21(2):193-202, Epub 2010 Oct 4, PMID: 20921232. The experiment studied the
    effect of RNAi knockdown of Pasilla, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of mammalian
    NOVA1 and NOVA2, on the transcriptome.  The package vignette describes how the
    data provided here were derived from the RNA-Seq read sequence data that are provided
    by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession numbers GSM461176 to GSM461181.'
