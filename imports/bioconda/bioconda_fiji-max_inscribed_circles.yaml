  description: 'ImageJ / Fiji plugin implementing an iterative Largest Inscribed Circle
    algorithm

    which runs over a binary image or selection in order to fit the maximum number

    of non-touching circles down to a minimum diameter.

    The approach uses a Euclidean Distance Map in order to find candidate circles

    from the largest to the smallest.

    The code is written for Java 8,

    which is the currently supported Java version for Fiji and ImageJ.
