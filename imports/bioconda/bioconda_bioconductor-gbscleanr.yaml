about:
  description: GBScleanR is a package for quality check, filtering, and error correction
    of genotype data derived from next generation sequcener (NGS) based genotyping
    platforms. GBScleanR takes Variant Call Format (VCF) file as input. The main function
    of this package is `estGeno()` which estimates the true genotypes of samples from
    given read counts for genotype markers using a hidden Markov model with incorporating
    uneven observation ratio of allelic reads. This implementation gives robust genotype
    estimation even in noisy genotype data usually observed in Genotyping-By-Sequnencing
    (GBS) and similar methods, e.g. RADseq. The current implementation accepts genotype
    data of a diploid population at any generation of multi-parental cross, e.g. biparental
    F2 from inbred parents, biparental F2 from outbred parents, and 8-way recombinant
    inbred lines (8-way RILs) which can be refered to as MAGIC population.
