about:
  description: 'An implementation of the pathway fingerprint framework that introduced
    in paper "Pathway Fingerprint: a novel pathway knowledge and topology based method
    for biomarker discovery and characterization". This method provides a systematic
    comparisons between a gene set (such as a list of differentially expressed genes)
    and well-studied "basic pathway networks" (KEGG pathways), measuring the importance
    of pathways and genes for the gene set. The package is helpful for researchers
    to find the biomarkers and its function.'
