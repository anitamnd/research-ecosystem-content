  notes: 'InDelFixer is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "InDelFixer" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "InDelFixer -Xms512m -Xmx1G"'
