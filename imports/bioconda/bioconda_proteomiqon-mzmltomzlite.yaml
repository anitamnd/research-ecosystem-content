  description: 'The success of modern proteomics was made possible by constant progression
    in the field of mass spectrometry. Over the course of the past years quite a few
    manufacturers of

    mass spectrometers have managed to establish themselfes in the field of biological
    research. Since aquisition and accession of mass spectra are performance critical
    processes,

    various performance optimized, but vendor specific and closed source formats have
    been developed to store raw MS data. This comes to the disadvantage for toolchain
    developers

    which want to provide tools for every scientist regardless of the format of their
    raw data.
