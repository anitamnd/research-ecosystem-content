  description: 'MAXIT assists in the processing and curation of macromolecular structure
    data. MAXIT can:

    - Read and write PDB and mmCIF format files, and translate between file formats.

    - Perform consistency checks on coordinates, sequence, and crystal data.

    - Automatically construct, transform, and merge information between formats

    - Align residue numbering in the coordinates with the sequence

    - Reorder and rename atoms in standard and nonstandard residues and ligands according
    to the Chemical Component Dictionary

    - Assign ligands the same chain IDs as the adjacent polymers

    - Detect missing or additional atoms
