about:
  description: This package contains a set of functions to perform several type of
    processing and analysis on CNVs calling pipelines/algorithms results in an integrated
    manner and regardless of the raw data type (SNPs array or NGS). It provides functions
    to combine multiple CNV calling results into a single object, filter them, compute
    CNVRs (CNV Regions) and inheritance patterns, detect genic load, and more. The
    package is best suited for studies in human family-based cohorts.
