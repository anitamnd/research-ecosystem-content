about:
  description: '| RLHub provides a convenient interface to the processed data provided
    within RLSuite, a tool-chain for analyzing R-loop-mapping data sets. The primary
    purpose of RLHub is to serve the processed data sets required by the RLSeq R package
    and the RLBase web service. Additionally, RLHub provides a stand-alone R interface
    to these data, benefiting users who are addressing questions related to R-loop
    regions (RL-Regions), R-loop-binding proteins (RLBPs), R-loop co-localizing factors,
    and the differences between R-loop-mapping methods. The full data-generating protocol
    is found here: https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLBase-data.'
