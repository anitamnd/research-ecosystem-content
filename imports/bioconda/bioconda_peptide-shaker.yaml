about:
  description: PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation
    of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines, currently supporting
    X!Tandem, MS-GF+, Metamorpheus, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide, Mascot,
    Andromeda and mzIdentML. By combining the results from multiple search engines,
    while re-calculating PTM localization scores and redoing the protein inference,
    PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics
    data!

  notes: PeptideShaker is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default "-Xms512m
    -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can specify these
    values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this
    will take precedence. For example run it with "peptide-shaker -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
