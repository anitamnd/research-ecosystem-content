  description: "Given an MS run in the mzLite or mzml format and a list of fdr controlled\
    \ peptide spectrum matches, this tool iterates accross all identified MS/MS scans\
    \ and groups them by\nthe assigned peptide ion. The scan times of each MS/MS spectrum\
    \ are then weighted according to the quality of each match to build an reliable\
    \ estimator for the scan time of\nthe peptide ion in question. This scan time\
    \ estimator, combined with the monoisotopic m/z, is then used to extract an ion\
    \ chromatogram. Using wavelet based peak detection \ntechniques we identify all\
    \ peaks present in the XIC and select the most probable peak our target for quantification.\
    \ Using parameter estimation techniques we subsequently \nuse peak fitting to\
    \ fit a set of two gaussian models to the detected peak, from whom the one with\
    \ the better fit is selected. This allows us not only to report how well \nthe\
    \ signal fitted to the theoretical expected peak shape but also to obtain accurate\
    \ estimates for the peak area, our estimator for peptide ion abundance.\nThe quantification\
    \ tool was designed to allow label-free quantification as well as quantification\
    \ of full metabolic labeled samples. For this we use the known identity \nof one\
    \ of the the peptide ions and calculate the m/z of the unobserved differentially\
    \ labeled counterpart to extract and quantify the corresponding XIC.\n"
