  summary: Command line NoD (clinod), for  predicting nucleolar localization sequences.
build:
  noarch: generic
  number: 4
extra:
  notes: 'Command line NoD (clinod) is Java program which is packaged with a custom

    wrapper shell script. This shell wrapper is called "clinod" and is on $PATH

    by default. By default "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want

    to overwrite it you can specify these values directly after your binaries.

    If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "clinod -Xms512m -Xmx1g ..."'
