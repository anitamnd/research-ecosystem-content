about:
  description: hpcblast provides a simple and efficient method for running the NCBI-BLAST+
    suite program in localhost or the HPC environment (Sun Grid Engine). It splits
    the input sequence file and run all chunked tasks in parallel to accelerate the
    blast search speed. When there are many sequences in the input file for blast
    comparison and the running speed is slow, using hpcblast can significantly improve
    the performance. All of this can be easy done only by adding the hpc-blast command
    at the head of your blast command line.
