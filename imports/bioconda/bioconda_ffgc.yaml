about:
  description: "Family Free Genome Comparison (FFGC) is a self-contained workflow\
    \ system that\nprovides functionality for all steps of a family-free gene order\
    \ analysis\nstarting from annotated genome sequences.\n\nFamily-free methods for\
    \ gene order analyses do not require prior knowledge of\nevolutionary relationships\
    \ between the genes across the studied genomes. This\ntool features a complete\
    \ workflow for genome comparison, requiring nothing\nbut annotated genome sequences\
    \ as input.\n\nSurprisingly, the continuous development of family-free methods\
    \ recently lead\nto an integrated method for inferring gene families across several\
    \ species.\nFFGC now includes a subworkflow for inferring gene families simultaneously\n\
    based on gene similarities and family-free genome rearrangements (OrthoFFGC\u029C\
    \nand OrthoFFGC\u029C\u2248 extensions).\n\nFFGC is available for download at\
    \ our git repository\n(https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/gi/FFGC) or as a\nConda\
    \ package at Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/ffgc).\n\nIn general, three\
    \ major steps are performed: (1) the computation of local\nsequence alignment\
    \ scores between genes of two or more gene order sequences\nusing BLAST+ or Diamond;\
    \ (2) the establishment of gene relationships; and\n(3) the actual family-free\
    \ gene order analysis.\n"
