about:
  description: 'This package brings the GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) functionalities
    into the R environment. GMQL is a high-level, declarative language to manage heterogeneous
    genomic datasets for biomedical purposes, using simple queries to process genomic
    regions and their metadata and properties. GMQL adopts algorithms efficiently
    designed for big data using cloud-computing technologies (like Apache Hadoop and
    Spark) allowing GMQL to run on modern infrastructures, in order to achieve scalability
    and high performance. It allows to create, manipulate and extract genomic data
    from different data sources both locally and remotely. Our RGMQL functions allow
    complex queries and processing leveraging on the R idiomatic paradigm. The RGMQL
    package also provides a rich set of ancillary classes that allow sophisticated
    input/output management and sorting, such as: ASC, DESC, BAG, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG,
    MEDIAN, STD, Q1, Q2, Q3 (and many others). Note that many RGMQL functions are
    not directly executed in R environment, but are deferred until real execution
    is issued.'
