  description: "Ancient DNA data is characterized by deamination and low-coverage\
    \ sequencing, which results in a high fraction of missing data and erroneous calls.\
    \ \nThese factors affect the estimation of phylogenetic trees with modern and\
    \ ancient DNA, especially when dealing with many ancient samples sequenced to\
    \ lower coverage. \nFurthermore, most ancient DNA analyses of the Y chromosome,\
    \ for example, rely on previously known markers, but additional variation will\
    \ continuously emerge as more data is generated. \nThis workflow offers a solution\
    \ for integrating ancient and present-day haploid data, first by identifiying\
    \ informative markers in a high coverage dataset, second, by calling and filtering\
    \ these SNPs in ancient samples and lastly, by traversing the tree and evaluate\
    \ the number of derived and ancestral markers in the ancients to find the most\
    \ likely branch where it belongs.\n"
