about:
  description: The classification protocol starts with a feature selection step and
    continues with nearest-centroid classification. The accurarcy of the predictor
    can be evaluated using training and test set validation, leave-one-out cross-validation
    or in a multiple random validation protocol. Methods for calculation and visualization
    of continuous prediction scores allow to balance sensitivity and specificity and
    define a cutoff value according to clinical requirements.
