about:
  description: An R package for subset-based analysis of heterogeneous traits and
    disease subtypes. The package allows the user to search through all possible subsets
    of z-scores to identify the subset of traits giving the best meta-analyzed z-score.
    Further, it returns a p-value adjusting for the multiple-testing involved in the
    search. It also allows for searching for the best combination of disease subtypes
    associated with each variant.
