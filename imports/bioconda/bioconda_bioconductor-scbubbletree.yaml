about:
  description: scBubbletree is a quantitative method for visual exploration of scRNA-seq
    data. It preserves biologically meaningful properties of scRNA-seq data, such
    as local and global cell distances, as well as the density distribution of cells
    across the sample. scBubbletree is scalable and avoids the overplotting problem,
    and is able to visualize diverse cell attributes derived from multiomic single-cell
    experiments. Importantly, Importantly, scBubbletree is easy to use and to integrate
    with popular approaches for scRNA-seq data analysis.
