about:
  description: ExCluster flattens Ensembl and GENCODE GTF files into GFF files, which
    are used to count reads per non-overlapping exon bin from BAM files. This read
    counting is done using the function featureCounts from the package Rsubread. Library
    sizes are normalized across all biological replicates, and ExCluster then compares
    two different conditions to detect signifcantly differentially spliced genes.
    This process requires at least two independent biological repliates per condition,
    and ExCluster accepts only exactly two conditions at a time. ExCluster ultimately
    produces false discovery rates (FDRs) per gene, which are used to detect significance.
    Exon log2 fold change (log2FC) means and variances may be plotted for each significantly
    differentially spliced gene, which helps scientists develop hypothesis and target
    differential splicing events for RT-qPCR validation in the wet lab.

  summary: ExCluster robustly detects differentially expressed exons between two conditions
    of RNA-seq data, requiring at least two independent biological replicates per
