about:
  description: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to explore cellular
    variation. The analysis of scRNA-seq data often starts from clustering cells into
    subpopulations. This initial step has a high impact on downstream analyses, and
    hence it is important to be accurate. However, there have not been unsupervised
    metric designed for scRNA-seq to evaluate clustering performance. Hence, we propose
    clustering deviation index (CDI), an unsupervised metric based on the modeling
    of scRNA-seq UMI counts to evaluate clustering of cells.
