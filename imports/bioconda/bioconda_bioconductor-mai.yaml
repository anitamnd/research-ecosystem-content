about:
  description: A two-step approach to imputing missing data in metabolomics. Step
    1 uses a random forest classifier to classify missing values as either Missing
    Completely at Random/Missing At Random (MCAR/MAR) or Missing Not At Random (MNAR).
    MCAR/MAR are combined because it is often difficult to distinguish these two missing
    types in metabolomics data. Step 2 imputes the missing values based on the classified
    missing mechanisms, using the appropriate imputation algorithms. Imputation algorithms
    tested and available for MCAR/MAR include Bayesian Principal Component Analysis
    (BPCA), Multiple Imputation No-Skip K-Nearest Neighbors (Multi_nsKNN), and Random
    Forest. Imputation algorithms tested and available for MNAR include nsKNN and
    a single imputation approach for imputation of metabolites where left-censoring
    is present.
