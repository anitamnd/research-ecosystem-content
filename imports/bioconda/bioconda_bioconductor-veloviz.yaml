about:
  description: "VeloViz uses each cell\u2019s current observed and predicted future\
    \ transcriptional states inferred from RNA velocity analysis to build a nearest\
    \ neighbor graph between cells in the population. Edges are then pruned based\
    \ on a cosine correlation threshold and/or a distance threshold and the resulting\
    \ graph is visualized using a force-directed graph layout algorithm. VeloViz can\
    \ help ensure that relationships between cell states are reflected in the 2D embedding,\
    \ allowing for more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories."
