  description: 'reCOGnizer performs domain based annotation with RPS-BLAST, using

    Hidden Markov Models (HMM) from COG database. It rebuilds COG database

    for multithreaded annotation, organizes information regarding COG IDs

    and respective categories, obtains EC numbers using resources from the

    eggNOG database and organizes all this information into TSV and EXCEL

    files for easy handling by users or pipelines. It also produces a Krona

    plot representing the quantification of COG functions identified.
