about:
  description: 'LSA was developed as a pre-assembly tool for partitioning metagenomic
    reads.

    It uses a hyperplane hashing function and streaming SVD in order to find

    covariance relations between k-mers. The code, and the process outline in

    LSFScripts in particular, have been optimized to scale to massive data

    sets in fixed memory with a highly distributed computing environment.
