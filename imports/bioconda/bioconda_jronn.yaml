about:
  description: 'JRONN is a Java implementation of RONN. JRONN is based on RONN and
    uses the same model data, therefore gives the same predictions. Main motivation
    behind JRONN development was providing an implementation of RONN more suitable
    to use by the automated analysis pipelines and web services.

    Original version of RONN is described in Yang,Z.R., Thomson,R., McMeil,P. and
    Esnouf,R.M. (2005) RONN: the bio-basis function neural network technique applied
    to the detection of natively disordered regions in proteins Bioinformatics 21:

  notes: JRONN is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script. The
    shell wrapper is called "jronn" and is present on $PATH by default. The Java program
    is executed by jvm pointed to by the $JAVA_HOME variable. Otherwise, a "java"
    program from the current environment is used.
