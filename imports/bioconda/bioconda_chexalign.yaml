about:
  description: ChExAlign is a computational framework that aligns ChIP-exo crosslinking
    patterns from multiple proteins across a set of regulatory regions, and which
    detects and quantifies protein-DNA crosslinking events within the aligned profiles.
    The output of the alignment approach is a set of composite profiles that represent
    the crosslinking signatures of the complex across analyzed regulatory regions.
    We then use a probabilistic mixture model to deconvolve individual crosslinking
    events within the aligned ChIP-exo profiles, enabling consistent measurements
    of protein-DNA crosslinking strengths across multiple proteins.

  summary: ChExAlign is used for alignment and quantification of ChIP-exo crosslinking
    patterns.
