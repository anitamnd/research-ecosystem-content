about:
  description: 'Kalamari is a curated database of assemblies and taxonomies.

    These assemblies are curated mainly for foodborne bacteria but have other taxa

    such as SARS-CoV-2 and Crytposporidium.

    Taxonomy has been modified from NCBI Taxonomy and has been minimalized to

    just what is needed here.
