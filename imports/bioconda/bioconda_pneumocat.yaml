  summary: PneumoCaT (Pneumococcal Capsular Typing) uses a two-step step approach
    to assign capsular type to S.pneumoniae genomic data (Illumina)
build:
  noarch: generic
  number: 1
description: 'In the first step, reads from each readset are mapped to capsular locus
  sequences for all known capsular types (92 for S. pneumoniae plus 2 additional subtypes/molecular
  types).

  This step is considered successful if the readset matches > 90% to 1 or more capsular
  locus sequences.

  If it matches to a single capsular locus then PneumoCaT terminates here and reports
  this as the assigned capsular type.

  If more than 1 loci are matched then the tool moves to the second step; a variant
  based approach that utilises the capsular type variant (CTV) database to distinguish
  serotypes within a serogroup/genogroup.
