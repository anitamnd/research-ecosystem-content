  description: "EvidentialGene is a genome informatics project for \"Evidence Directed\
    \ Gene Construction for Eukaryotes\", \nfor constructing high quality, accurate\
    \ gene sets for animals and plants (any eukaryotes), being developed \nby Don\
    \ Gilbert at Indiana University, gilbertd at indiana edu. The perl scripts are\
    \ nested inside the \n'scripts' folder and, therefor can only be used by providing\
    \ the full path \nsuch as '$EVIGENEHOME/scripts/prot/tr2aacds.pl -h'\n"
