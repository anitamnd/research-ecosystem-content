about:
  description: The SWeeP method was developed to favor the analizes between amino
    acids sequences and to assist alignment free phylogenetic studies. This method
    is based on the concept of sparse words, which is applied in the scan of biological
    sequences and its the conversion in a matrix of ocurrences. Aiming the generation
    of low dimensional matrices of Amino Acid Sequence occurrences.
