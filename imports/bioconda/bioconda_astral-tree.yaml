  description: "ASTRAL is a tool for estimating an unrooted species tree given a set\
    \ of unrooted gene trees. \nASTRAL is statistically consistent under the multi-species\
    \ coalescent model \n(and thus is useful for handling incomplete lineage sorting,\
    \ i.e., ILS). \nASTRAL finds the species tree that has the maximum number of shared\
    \ induced \nquartet trees with the set of gene trees, subject to the constraint\
    \ that \nthe set of bipartitions in the species tree comes from a predefined set\
    \ of bipartitions. \nThis predefined set is empirically decided by ASTRAL (but\
    \ see tutorial on how to expand it). \nThe current code corresponds to ASTRAL-III.\n"

  notes: 'astral is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The command that
    runs the program is ''astral''. If you want to overwrite it you can specify memory
    options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this
    will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-fastqsplitter -Xms512m
    -Xmx1g''. '
