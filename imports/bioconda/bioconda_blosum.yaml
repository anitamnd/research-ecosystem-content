  description: 'The BLOcks SUbstitution Matrices (BLOSUM) are used to score alignments
    between protein sequences and are therefore mainly used in bioinformatics. Reading
    such matrices is not particularly difficult, yet most off the shelf packages are
    overloaded with strange dependencies. And why do we need to implement the same
    reader again if there is a simple module for that. blosum offers a robust and
    easy-to-expand implementation without relying on third-party libraries.
