  summary: SingleM is a tool for profiling shotgun metagenomes. It has a particular
    strength in detecting microbial lineages which are not in reference databases.
    The method it uses also makes it suitable for some related tasks, such as assessing
    eukaryotic contamination, finding bias in genome recovery, and lineage-targeted
    MAG recovery.
