about:
  description: 'Seqstr is designed to provide a concise and flexible way to specify
    long genomic sequences that can be used for downstream analysis. For example,
    it can be used by web servers to avoid transferring long genomic sequences. Seqstr
    is also a format specification, which can be implemented in different languages.
    We also provide a test suite for verifying an implementation.
