about:
  description: This package enables the visualization of functional enrichment results
    as network graphs. First the package enables the visualization of enrichment results,
    in a format corresponding to the one generated by gprofiler2, as a customizable
    Cytoscape network. In those networks, both gene datasets (GO terms/pathways/protein
    complexes) and genes associated to the datasets are represented as nodes. While
    the edges connect each gene to its dataset(s). The package also provides the option
    to create enrichment maps from functional enrichment results. Enrichment maps
    enable the visualization of enriched terms into a network with edges connecting
    overlapping genes.
