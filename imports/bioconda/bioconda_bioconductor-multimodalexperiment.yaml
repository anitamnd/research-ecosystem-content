about:
  description: MultimodalExperiment is an S4 class that integrates bulk and single-cell
    experiment data; it is optimally storage-efficient, and its methods are exceptionally
    fast. It effortlessly represents multimodal data of any nature and features normalized
    experiment, subject, sample, and cell annotations, which are related to underlying
    biological experiments through maps. Its coordination methods are opt-in and employ
    database-like join operations internally to deliver fast and flexible management
    of multimodal data.
