about:
  description: 'This package contains the CADD-scripts.  Please note that the "CADD.sh"

    script is available as "cadd.sh" while the "install.sh" script is

    available as "cadd-install.sh".


    The "Prerequisite" steps from the CADD-scripts repository README can

    be skipped as you already have conda installed with the proper channels

    if you can install this package and this package depends on the proper

    Snakemake version.
