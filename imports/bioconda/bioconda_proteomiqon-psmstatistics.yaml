  description: "To measure the similarity of in silico generated spectra and measured\
    \ MS/MS scans we use our own implementations of three established search enginge\
    \ scores: \nSEQUEST, Andromeda and XTandem. Additionally, we also record quality\
    \ control parameters such as the mass difference between the precursor ion and\
    \ the theoretically \ncalulated mass or the uniquness of each score in comparison\
    \ to 'competing' peptides within the search space. The PSMStatistics tool utilizes\
    \ semi supervised machine \nlearning techniques to integrate search engine scores\
    \ as well as the mentioned quality scores into one single consensus score.\nSince\
    \ the search space is extended by so called decoys - reversed counterparts of\
    \ peptides within the search space - we can estimate the distribution of 'true\
    \ negatives' and \ncalculate local (PEP values) and global (Q values) false discovery\
    \ rates at each consensus score. The reported peptides at user defined local and\
    \ global FDR cutoffs can then\nbe used as inputs for any downstream analysis be\
    \ it ProteinInference or PSMBasedQuantification.\n"
