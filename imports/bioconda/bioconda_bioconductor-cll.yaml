about:
  description: The CLL package contains the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) gene
    expression data.  The CLL data had 24 samples that were either classified as progressive
    or stable in regards to disease progression.  The data came from Dr. Sabina Chiaretti
    at Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology,
    University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy and Dr. Jerome Ritz at Department of Medicine,
    Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.
