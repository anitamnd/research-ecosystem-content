  description: "A pipeline for identifying differentially methylated CpG sites using\
    \ Hidden Markov Model in bisulfite sequencing data. DNA methylation studies have\
    \ enabled researchers to understand methylation patterns and their regulatory\
    \ roles in biological processes and disease. However, only a limited number of\
    \ statistical approaches have been developed to provide formal quantitative analysis.\
    \ Specifically, a few available methods do identify differentially methylated\
    \ CpG (DMC) sites or regions (DMR), but they suffer from limitations that arise\
    \ mostly due to challenges inherent in bisulfite sequencing data. These challenges\
    \ include: (1) that read-depths vary considerably among genomic positions and\
    \ are often low; (2) both methylation and autocorrelation patterns change as regions\
    \ change; and (3) CpG sites are distributed unevenly. Furthermore, there are several\
    \ methodological limitations: almost none of these tools is capable of comparing\
    \ multiple groups and/or working with missing values, and only a few allow continuous\
    \ or multiple covariates. The last of these is of great interest among researchers,\
    \ as the goal is often to find which regions of the genome are associated with\
    \ several exposures and traits. To tackle these issues, we have developed an efficient\
    \ DMC identification method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) called \u201C\
    DMCHMM\u201D which is a three-step approach (model selection, prediction, testing)\
    \ aiming to address the aforementioned drawbacks."
