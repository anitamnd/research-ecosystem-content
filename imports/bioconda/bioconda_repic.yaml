about:
  description: REliable PIcking by Consensus (REPIC) is an ensemble learning approach
    to cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) particle picking. It identifies particles
    common to multiple picked particle sets (i.e., consensus particles) using graph
    theory and integer linear programming (ILP). Picked particle sets may be found
    by a human specialist (manual), template matching, mathematical function (e.g.,
    RELION's Laplacian-of-Gaussian auto-picking), or machine-learning method. REPIC
    expects particle sets to be in BOX file format (*.box) where each particle has
    coordinates, a detection box size (in pixels), and (optional) a score [0-1].
