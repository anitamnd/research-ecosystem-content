about:
  description: RLassoCox is a package that implements the RLasso-Cox model proposed
    by Wei Liu. The RLasso-Cox model integrates gene interaction information into
    the Lasso-Cox model for accurate survival prediction and survival biomarker discovery.
    It is based on the hypothesis that topologically important genes in the gene interaction
    network tend to have stable expression changes. The RLasso-Cox model uses random
    walk to evaluate the topological weight of genes, and then highlights topologically
    important genes to improve the generalization ability of the Lasso-Cox model.
    The RLasso-Cox model has the advantage of identifying small gene sets with high
    prognostic performance on independent datasets, which may play an important role
    in identifying robust survival biomarkers for various cancer types.
