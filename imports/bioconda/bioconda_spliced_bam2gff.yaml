  description: "The spliced_bam2gff tool converts BAM alignments, produced by spliced\
    \ aligners (such as minimap2, gmap), into a GFF2 format.\n\nBy default, introns\
    \ are created based on the N cigar feature. Alternatively, if -d (i.e. for deletion)\
    \ is specified, any deletions larger than the limit will be classified as an intron.\
    \ The orientation of the GFF2 features is determined by the XS strand tag and\
    \ SAM flags depending on the aligner.\n\nThe tool supports splitting the output\
    \ into loci and bundles of loci with a minimum number of features, which enables\
    \ easy parallelisation of downstream analyses. \n"
