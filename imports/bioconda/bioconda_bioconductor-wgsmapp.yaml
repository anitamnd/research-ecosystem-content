about:
  description: "This package provides whole-genome mappability tracks on human hg19/hg38\
    \ assembly. We employed the 100-mers mappability track from the ENCODE Project\
    \ and computed weighted average of the mappability scores if multiple ENCODE regions\
    \ overlap with the same bin. \u201CBlacklist\u201D bins, including segmental duplication\
    \ regions and gaps in reference assembly from telomere, centromere, and/or heterochromatin\
    \ regions are included. The dataset consists of three assembled .bam files of\
    \ single-cell whole genome sequencing from 10X for illustration purposes."
