about:
  description: DMRforPairs (formerly DMR2+) allows researchers to compare n>=2 unique
    samples with regard to their methylation profile. The (pairwise) comparison of
    n unique single samples distinguishes DMRforPairs from other existing pipelines
    as these often compare groups of samples in either single CpG locus or region
    based analysis. DMRforPairs defines regions of interest as genomic ranges with
    sufficient probes located in close proximity to each other. Probes in one region
    are optionally annotated to the same functional class(es). Differential methylation
    is evaluated by comparing the methylation values within each region between individual
    samples and (if the difference is sufficiently large), testing this difference
    formally for statistical significance.
