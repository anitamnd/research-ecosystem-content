about:
  description: cytoKernel implements a kernel-based score test to identify differentially
    expressed features in high-dimensional biological experiments. This approach can
    be applied across many different high-dimensional biological data including gene
    expression data and dimensionally reduced cytometry-based marker expression data.
    In this R package, we implement functions that compute the feature-wise p values
    and their corresponding adjusted p values. Additionally, it also computes the
    feature-wise shrunk effect sizes and their corresponding shrunken effect size.
    Further, it calculates the percent of differentially expressed features and plots
    user-friendly heatmap of the top differentially expressed features on the rows
    and samples on the columns.
