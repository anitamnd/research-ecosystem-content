about:
  description: "Results from PSMBasedQuantification contain detailed information about\
    \ the quantification of every peptide, but only basic informations about the protein\
    \ they \noriginated from. This information is obtained during the ProteinInference.\
    \ This tool takes the results from both tools and combines the quantification\
    \ information \nof each peptide with the more accurate information about the corresponding\
    \ protein including its q-value.\n"
