about:
  description: adverSCarial is an R Package designed for generating and analyzing
    the vulnerability of scRNA-seq classifiers to adversarial attacks. The package
    is versatile and provides a format for integrating any type of classifier. It
    offers functions for studying and generating two types of attacks, single gene
    attack and max change attack. The single gene attack involves making a small modification
    to the input to alter the classification. The max change attack involves making
    a large modification to the input without changing its classification. The package
    provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness of scRNA-seq classifiers
    against adversarial attacks.
