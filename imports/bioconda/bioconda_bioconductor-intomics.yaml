  description: 'IntOMICS is an efficient integrative framework based on Bayesian networks.
    IntOMICS systematically analyses gene expression (GE), DNA methylation (METH),
    copy number variation (CNV) and biological prior knowledge (B) to infer regulatory
    networks. IntOMICS complements the missing biological prior knowledge by so-called
    empirical biological knowledge (empB), estimated from the available experimental
    data. An automatically tuned MCMC algorithm (Yang and Rosenthal, 2017) estimates
    model parameters and the empirical biological knowledge. Conventional MCMC algorithm
    with additional Markov blanket resampling (MBR) step (Su and Borsuk, 2016) infers
    resulting regulatory network structure consisting of three types of nodes: GE
    nodes refer to gene expression levels, CNV nodes refer to associated copy number
    variations, and METH nodes refer to associated DNA methylation probe(s).'
