about:
  description: DeconSeq is an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues
    based on mRNA-Seq data. It modeled expression levels from heterogeneous cell populations
    in mRNA-Seq as the weighted average of expression from different constituting
    cell types and predicted cell type proportions of single expression profiles.
