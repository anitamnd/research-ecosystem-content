  description: 'The goal of LRcell is to identify specific sub-cell types that drives
    the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression experiment.
    To achieve this, LRcell utilizes sets of cell marker genes acquired from single-cell
    RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) as indicators for various cell types in the tissue
    of interest. Next, for each cell type, using its marker genes as indicators, we
    apply Logistic Regression on the complete set of genes with differential expression
    p-values to calculate a cell-type significance p-value. Finally, these p-values
    are compared to predict which one(s) are likely to be responsible for the differential
    gene expression pattern observed in the bulk RNA-seq experiments. LRcell is inspired
    by the LRpath[@sartor2009lrpath] algorithm developed by Sartor et al., originally
    designed for pathway/gene set enrichment analysis. LRcell contains three major
    components: LRcell analysis, plot generation and marker gene selection. All modules
    in this package are written in R. This package also provides marker genes in the
    Prefrontal Cortex (pFC) human brain region, human PBMC and nine mouse brain regions
    (Frontal Cortex, Cerebellum, Globus Pallidus, Hippocampus, Entopeduncular, Posterior
    Cortex, Striatum, Substantia Nigra and Thalamus).'
