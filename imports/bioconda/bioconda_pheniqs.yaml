  summary: Pheniqs is a flexible generic barcode classifier for high-throughput next-gen
    sequencing written in multi threaded C++11. It caters to a wide variety of experimental
    designs by addressing multiple combinatorial index tags in arbitrary locations
    along reads. Pheniqs implements a noise and quality aware probabilistic classifier
    with improved accuracy over standard edit distance methods and reports classification
    quality in standard SAM auxiliary tags. Please not configuation syntax has slightly
    changed for 2.1.x version.
