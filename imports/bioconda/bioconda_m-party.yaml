about:
  description: "M-PARTY takes an input FASTA file with a variable number of aminoacidic\n\
    sequences and performes a search against an considerable amount of Hidden \nMarkov\
    \ Models, previously built and trained from state of the art plastic \n(PE - polyethylene)\
    \ degrading enzymes. This process relies on the hmmsearch \nfunction from HMMER\
    \ to perform the structural annotation. Output deduces \nabout the potential presence\
    \ of plastic degradring enzymes in the inputed\nsequences, and is composed by\
    \ 3 distinct files, in order to help the user \nto have an easier time to read\
    \ and conclude about the results.\n"
