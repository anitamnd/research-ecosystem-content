about:
  description: iBBiG is a bi-clustering algorithm which is optimizes for binary data
    analysis. We apply it to meta-gene set analysis of large numbers of gene expression
    datasets. The iterative algorithm extracts groups of phenotypes from multiple
    studies that are associated with similar gene sets. iBBiG does not require prior
    knowledge of the number or scale of clusters and allows discovery of clusters
    with diverse sizes
