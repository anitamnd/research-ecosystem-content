  description: 'Genotyping By Sequencing demultipleXing toolkit (GBSX) is a toolkit
    with an

    inline barcode demultiplexer for usage in the analysis of single read or

    paired-end genotyping by sequence (GBS) data, a barcode generator, a barcode

    discovery tool, and a restriction enzyme predictor. GBSX can easily be

    incorperated as a preceding analysis step for already deployed SNP pipelines.

  notes: 'GBSX is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "gbsx" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "gbsx -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
