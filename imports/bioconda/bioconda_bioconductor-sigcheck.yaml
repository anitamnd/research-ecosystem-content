about:
  description: While gene signatures are frequently used to predict phenotypes (e.g.
    predict prognosis of cancer patients), it it not always clear how optimal or meaningful
    they are (cf David Venet, Jacques E. Dumont, and Vincent Detours' paper "Most
    Random Gene Expression Signatures Are Significantly Associated with Breast Cancer
    Outcome"). Based on suggestions in that paper, SigCheck accepts a data set (as
    an ExpressionSet) and a gene signature, and compares its performance on survival
    and/or classification tasks against a) random gene signatures of the same length;
    b) known, related and unrelated gene signatures; and c) permuted data and/or metadata.

  summary: Check a gene signature's prognostic performance against random signatures,
    known signatures, and permuted data/metadata
