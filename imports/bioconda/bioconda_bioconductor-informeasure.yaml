about:
  description: 'This package compiles most of the information measures currently available:
    mutual information, conditional mutual information, interaction information, partial
    information decomposition and part mutual information. All of these estimators
    can be used to quantify nonlinear dependence between variables in (biological
    regulatory) network inference. The first estimator is used to infer bivariate
    networks while the last four estimators are dedicated to analysis of trivariate
    networks.'
