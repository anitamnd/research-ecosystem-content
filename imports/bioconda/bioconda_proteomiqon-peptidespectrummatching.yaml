  description: "Given raw a MS run in the mzLite or mzml format, this tool iterates\
    \ accross all recorded MS/MS scans and determines the charge state of precursor\
    \ \nions which were selected for fragmentation. With this it is possible to query\
    \ the peptide data base for every precursor ion mass +/- a\ntolerance (which defines\
    \ the so called 'search space') and retrieve peptides that are theoretical candidates\
    \ for a match. For each of the peptide\ncandidates we create an theoretical spectrum\
    \ in silico and compare it to the measured MS/MS scan.\n"

  summary: Given raw an MS run in the mzLite format, this tool iterates across all
    MS/MS scans, determines precursor charge states and possible peptide spectrum
    matches using reimplementations of SEQUEST, Andromeda and XTandem.
