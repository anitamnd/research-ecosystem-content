about:
  description: Pathways, reactions, and biological entities in Reactome knowledge
    are systematically represented as an ordered network. Instances are represented
    as nodes and relationships between instances as edges; they are all stored in
    the Reactome Graph Database. This package serves as an interface to query the
    interconnected data from a local Neo4j database, with the aim of minimizing the
    usage of Neo4j Cypher queries.
