about:
  description: This package provides an integrated analysis workflow for robust and
    reproducible analysis of mass spectrometry proteomics data for differential protein
    expression or differential enrichment. It requires tabular input (e.g. txt files)
    as generated by quantitative analysis softwares of raw mass spectrometry data,
    such as MaxQuant or IsobarQuant. Functions are provided for data preparation,
    filtering, variance normalization and imputation of missing values, as well as
    statistical testing of differentially enriched / expressed proteins. It also includes
    tools to check intermediate steps in the workflow, such as normalization and missing
    values imputation. Finally, visualization tools are provided to explore the results,
    including heatmap, volcano plot and barplot representations. For scientists with
    limited experience in R, the package also contains wrapper functions that entail
    the complete analysis workflow and generate a report. Even easier to use are the
    interactive Shiny apps that are provided by the package.
