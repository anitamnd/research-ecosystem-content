about:
  description: Viral Taxonomic Assignment Pipeline (VITAP) is a cutting-edge tool
    designed to address the growing need for accurate and comprehensive classification
    of DNA and RNA viral sequences. By integrating alignment-based techniques with
    graph theory, VITAP achieves high precision in classifying viral sequences, including
    those as short as 1000 base pairs, down to the genus level.
