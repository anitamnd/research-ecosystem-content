about:
  description: This package provides methods to identify active transcriptional programs.
    Methods and classes are provided to import or infer large scale co-regulatory
    network from transcriptomic data. The specificity of the encoded networks is to
    model Transcription Factor cooperation. External regulation evidences (TFBS, ChIP,...)
    can be integrated to assess the inferred network and refine it if necessary. Transcriptional
    activity of the regulators in the network can be estimated using an measure of
    their influence in a given sample. Finally, an interactive UI can be used to navigate
    through the network of cooperative regulators and to visualize their activity
    in a specific sample or subgroup sample. The proposed visualization tool can be
    used to integrate gene expression, transcriptional activity, copy number status,
    sample classification and a transcriptional network including co-regulation information.
