about:
  description: 'While some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are assigned critical regulatory
    roles, most remain functionally uncharacterized. This presents a challenge whenever
    an interesting set of ncRNAs needs to be analyzed in a functional context. Transcripts
    located close-by on the genome are often regulated together. This genomic proximity
    on the sequence can hint to a functional association. We present a tool, NoRCE,
    that performs cis enrichment analysis for a given set of ncRNAs. Enrichment is
    carried out using the functional annotations of the coding genes located proximal
    to the input ncRNAs. Other biologically relevant information such as topologically
    associating domain (TAD) boundaries, co-expression patterns, and miRNA target
    prediction information can be incorporated to conduct a richer enrichment analysis.
    To this end, NoRCE includes several relevant datasets as part of its data repository,
    including cell-line specific TAD boundaries, functional gene sets, and expression
    data for coding & ncRNAs specific to cancer. Additionally, the users can utilize
    custom data files in their investigation. Enrichment results can be retrieved
    in a tabular format or visualized in several different ways. NoRCE is currently
    available for the following species: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly,
    worm, and yeast.'
