about:
  description: 'nuCpos, a derivative of NuPoP, is an R package for prediction of nucleosome
    positions. nuCpos calculates local and whole nucleosomal histone binding affinity
    (HBA) scores for a given 147-bp sequence. Note: This package was designed to demonstrate
    the use of chemical maps in prediction. As the parental package NuPoP now provides
    chemical-map-based prediction, the function for dHMM-based prediction was removed
    from this package. nuCpos continues to provide functions for HBA calculation.'
