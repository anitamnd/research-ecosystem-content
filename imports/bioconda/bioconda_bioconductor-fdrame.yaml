about:
  description: This package contains two main functions. The first is fdr.ma which
    takes normalized expression data array, experimental design and computes adjusted
    p-values It returns the fdr adjusted p-values and plots, according to the methods
    described in (Reiner, Yekutieli and Benjamini 2002). The second, is fdr.gui()
    which creates a simple graphic user interface to access fdr.ma
