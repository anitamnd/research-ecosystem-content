about:
  description: An approach to filter out and/or identify phytoplankton cells from
    all particles measured via flow cytometry pigment and cell complexity information.
    It does this using a sequence of one-dimensional gates on pre-defined channels
    measuring certain pigmentation and complexity. The package is especially tuned
    for cyanobacteria, but will work fine for phytoplankton communities where there
    is at least one cell characteristic that differentiates every phytoplankton in
    the community.
