about:
  description: FeatSeekR performs unsupervised feature selection using replicated
    measurements. It iteratively selects features with the highest reproducibility
    across replicates, after projecting out those dimensions from the data that are
    spanned by the previously selected features. The selected a set of features has
    a high replicate reproducibility and a high degree of uniqueness.
