about:
  description: This is a microarray data set on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, published
    in 2002 (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell 2002). The experiments were conducted in the St.Jude
    Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenessee, USA. The raw data was preprocessed
    by variance stabilizing normalization (Huber et al.) on probe and subsequent summarization
    of probe expression values into probe set expression values using median polish.
