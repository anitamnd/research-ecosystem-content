about:
  description: We have developed the human disease ontology R package HDO.db, which
    provides the semantic relationship between human diseases. Relying on the DOSE
    and GOSemSim packages we developed, we can carry out disease enrichment and semantic
    similarity analyses. Many biological studies are achieved through mouse models,
    and a large number of data indicate the association between genotypes and phenotypes
    or diseases.  The study of model organisms can be transformed into useful knowledge
    about normal human biology and disease to facilitate treatment and early screening
    for diseases. Organism-specific genotype-phenotypic associations can be applied
    to cross-species phenotypic studies to clarify previously unknown phenotypic connections
    in other species. Using the same principle to diseases can identify genetic associations
    and even help to identify disease associations that are not obvious. Therefore,
    as a supplement to HDO.db and DOSE, we developed mouse phenotypic ontology R package
    MPO.db.
