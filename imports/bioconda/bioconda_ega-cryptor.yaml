about:
  description: The EGACryptor v.2.0.0 is a JAVA-based application which enables submitters
    to produce EGA compliant encrypted files along with files for the encrypted and
    unencrypted md5sum for each file to be submitted. The application will generate
    an output folder that will by default mirror the directory structure containing
    the original files. This output folder can subsequently be uploaded to the EGA
    FTP staging area via an FTP or Aspera client.
