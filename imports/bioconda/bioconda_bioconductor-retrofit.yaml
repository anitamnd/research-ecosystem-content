about:
  description: RETROFIT is a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization framework
    to decompose cell type mixtures in ST data without using external single-cell
    expression references. RETROFIT outperforms existing reference-based methods in
    estimating cell type proportions and reconstructing gene expressions in simulations
    with varying spot size and sample heterogeneity, irrespective of the quality or
    availability of the single-cell reference. RETROFIT recapitulates known cell-type
    localization patterns in a Slide-seq dataset of mouse cerebellum without using
    any single-cell data.
