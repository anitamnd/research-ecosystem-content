about:
  description: magrene allows the identification and analysis of graph motifs in (duplicated)
    gene regulatory networks (GRNs), including lambda, V, PPI V, delta, and bifan
    motifs. GRNs can be tested for motif enrichment by comparing motif frequencies
    to a null distribution generated from degree-preserving simulated GRNs. Motif
    frequencies can be analyzed in the context of gene duplications to explore the
    impact of small-scale and whole-genome duplications on gene regulatory networks.
    Finally, users can calculate interaction similarity for gene pairs based on the
    Sorensen-Dice similarity index.
