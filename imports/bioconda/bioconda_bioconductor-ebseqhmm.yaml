about:
  description: The EBSeqHMM package implements an auto-regressive hidden Markov model
    for statistical analysis in ordered RNA-seq experiments (e.g. time course or spatial
    course data). The EBSeqHMM package provides functions to identify genes and isoforms
    that have non-constant expression profile over the time points/positions, and
    cluster them into expression paths.
