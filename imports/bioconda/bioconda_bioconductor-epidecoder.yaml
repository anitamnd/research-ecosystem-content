about:
  description: epidecodeR is a package capable of analysing impact of degree of DNA/RNA
    epigenetic chemical modifications on dysregulation of genes or proteins. This
    package integrates chemical modification data generated from a host of epigenomic
    or epitranscriptomic techniques such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, m6A-seq, etc. and
    dysregulated gene lists in the form of differential gene expression, ribosome
    occupancy or differential protein translation and identify impact of dysregulation
    of genes caused due to varying degrees of chemical modifications associated with
    the genes. epidecodeR generates cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots showing
    shifts in trend of overall log2FC between genes divided into groups based on the
    degree of modification associated with the genes. The tool also tests for significance
    of difference in log2FC between groups of genes.
