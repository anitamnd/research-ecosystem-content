about:
  description: This package helps identify mRNAs that are overexpressed in subsets
    of tumors relative to normal tissue. Ideal inputs would be paired tumor-normal
    data from the same tissue from many patients (>15 pairs). This unsupervised approach
    relies on the observation that oncogenes are characteristically overexpressed
    in only a subset of tumors in the population, and may help identify oncogene candidates
    purely based on differences in mRNA expression between previously unknown subtypes.
