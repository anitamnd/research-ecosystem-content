about:
  description: A prototype for a mechanism for specifying the types of parameters
    and the return value for an R function. This is meta-information that can be used
    to generate stubs for servers and various interfaces to these functions. Additionally,
    the arguments in a call to a typed function can be validated using the type specifications.
    We allow types to be specified as either i) by class name using either inheritance
    - is(x, className), or strict instance of - class(x) %in% className, or ii) a
    dynamic test given as an R expression which is evaluated at run-time. More precise
    information and interesting tests can be done via ii), but it is harder to use
    this information as meta-data as it requires more effort to interpret it and it
    is of course run-time information. It is typically more meaningful.
