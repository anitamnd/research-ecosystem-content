about:
  description: The speckle package contains functions for the analysis of single cell
    RNA-seq data. The speckle package currently contains functions to analyse differences
    in cell type proportions. There are also functions to estimate the parameters
    of the Beta distribution based on a given counts matrix, and a function to normalise
    a counts matrix to the median library size. There are plotting functions to visualise
    cell type proportions and the mean-variance relationship in cell type proportions
    and counts. As our research into specialised analyses of single cell data continues
    we anticipate that the package will be updated with new functions.
