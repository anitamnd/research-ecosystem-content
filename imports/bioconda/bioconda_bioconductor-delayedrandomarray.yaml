about:
  description: Implements a DelayedArray of random values where the realization of
    the sampled values is delayed until they are needed. Reproducible sampling within
    any subarray is achieved by chunking where each chunk is initialized with a different
    random seed and stream. The usual distributions in the stats package are supported,
    along with scalar, vector and arrays for the parameters.
