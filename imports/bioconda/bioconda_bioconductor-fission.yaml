about:
  description: 'This package provides a RangedSummarizedExperiment object of read
    counts in genes for a time course RNA-Seq experiment of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces
    pombe) in response to oxidative stress (1M sorbitol treatment) at 0, 15, 30, 60,
    120 and 180 mins. The samples are further divided between a wild-type group and
    a group with deletion of atf21. The read count matrix was prepared and provided
    by the author of the study: Leong HS, Dawson K, Wirth C, Li Y, Connolly Y, Smith
    DL, Wilkinson CR, Miller CJ. "A global non-coding RNA system modulates fission
    yeast protein levels in response to stress". Nat Commun 2014 May 23;5:3947. PMID:
    24853205. GEO: GSE56761.'
