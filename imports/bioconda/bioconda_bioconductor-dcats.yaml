about:
  description: Methods to detect the differential composition abundances between conditions
    in singel-cell RNA-seq experiments, with or without replicates. It aims to correct
    bias introduced by missclaisification and enable controlling of confounding covariates.
    To avoid the influence of proportion change from big cell types, DCATS can use
    either total cell number or specific reference group as normalization term.
