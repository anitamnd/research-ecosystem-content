about:
  description: 'psytrans.py separates the sequences of a host species from those of
    its main symbiont(s) or parasite(s) based on Support Vector Machine classification.

    The program takes as input a file in fasta format with the sequences to be classified.

    The program also requires a file with sequences of a species related to the host,
    and a file with sequences related to the symbiont (or parasite).

    The queries will be compared to these two files using BLASTX.

    Alternatively, the user can provide the output of pre-computed BLASTX searches
    (in tabular format: -outfmt 6 or 7).

    The classification is then carried out using the command line tools from libsvm.
