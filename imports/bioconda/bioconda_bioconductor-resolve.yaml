about:
  description: Cancer is a genetic disease caused by somatic mutations in genes controlling
    key biological functions such as cellular growth and division. Such mutations
    may arise both through cell-intrinsic and exogenous processes, generating characteristic
    mutational patterns over the genome named mutational signatures. The study of
    mutational signatures have become a standard component of modern genomics studies,
    since it can reveal which (environmental and endogenous) mutagenic processes are
    active in a tumor, and may highlight markers for therapeutic response. Mutational
    signatures computational analysis presents many pitfalls. First, the task of determining
    the number of signatures is very complex and depends on heuristics. Second, several
    signatures have no clear etiology, casting doubt on them being computational artifacts
    rather than due to mutagenic processes. Last, approaches for signatures assignment
    are greatly influenced by the set of signatures used for the analysis. To overcome
    these limitations, we developed RESOLVE (Robust EStimation Of mutationaL signatures
    Via rEgularization), a framework that allows the efficient extraction and assignment
    of mutational signatures. RESOLVE implements a novel algorithm that enables (i)
    the efficient extraction, (ii) exposure estimation, and (iii) confidence assessment
    during the computational inference of mutational signatures.
