about:
  description: This package is built around the HPAStainR function. The purpose of
    the HPAStainR function is to query the visual staining data in the Human Protein
    Atlas to return a table of staining ranked cell types. The function also has multiple
    arguments to personalize to output as well to include cancer data, csv readable
    names, modify the confidence levels of the results and more. The other functions
    exist exclusively to easily acquire the data required to run HPAStainR.
