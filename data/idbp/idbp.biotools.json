PatchFinder searches for clusters (patches) of evolutionarily conserved residues on the protein surface. It was previously shown that the maximum-likelihood (ML) patches found by PatchFinder often delineate the functional regions in proteins, specifically, the core of DNA binding regions within DBPs.The iDBPs server uses the random forests classifier trained with global features of the proteins as well as features of their ML-patches. The features can be roughly divided into seven categories as follows:Surface electrostatic potential.Amino acid conservation patterns of the ML-patch.Secondary structure content.Amino acid content.Hydrogen donors/acceptors.Dipole moment.Spatial asymmetry of the distribution of specific amino acids.The",
