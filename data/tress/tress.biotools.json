                "abstract": "Motivation: The post-transcriptional epigenetic modification on mRNA is an emerging field to study the gene regulatory mechanism and their association with diseases. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technology named Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeRIP-seq) enables one to profile mRNA epigenetic modification transcriptome wide. A few computational methods are available to identify transcriptome-wide mRNA modification, but they are either limited by over-simplified model ignoring the biological variance across replicates or suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. Results: In this work, we develop a novel statistical method, based on an empirical Bayesian hierarchical model, to identify mRNA epigenetic modification regions from MeRIP-seq data. Our method accounts for various sources of variations in the data through rigorous modeling and applies shrinkage estimation by borrowing information from transcriptome-wide data to stabilize the parameter estimation. Simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that our method is more accurate, robust and efficient than the existing peak calling methods.",
