                "abstract": "Recently, the role of competing endogenous RNAs in regulating gene expression through the interaction of microRNAs has been closely associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in various biological processes such as reproduction and apoptosis. While the number of confirmed circRNA–miRNA interactions (CMIs) continues to increase, the conventional in vitro approaches for discovery are expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective prediction of potential CMIs through appropriate data modeling and prediction based on known information. In this study, we proposed a novel model, called DeepCMI, that utilizes multi-source information on circRNA/miRNA to predict potential CMIs. Comprehensive evaluations on the CMI-9905 and CMI-9589 datasets demonstrated that DeepCMI successfully infers potential CMIs. Specifically, DeepCMI achieved AUC values of 90.54% and 94.8% on the CMI-9905 and CMI-9589 datasets, respectively. These results suggest that DeepCMI is an effective model for predicting potential CMIs and has the potential to significantly reduce the need for downstream in vitro studies. To facilitate the use of our trained model and data, we have constructed a computational platform, which is available at http://120.77.11.78/DeepCMI/.
