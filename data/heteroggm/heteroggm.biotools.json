Network-based analysis takes interconnections as well as individual variable properties into consideration and can be more informative. Several Gaussian graphical model (GGM)-based heterogeneity analysis techniques have been developed, but friendly and portable software is still lacking. To facilitate more extensive usage, we develop the R package HeteroGGM, which conducts GGM-based heterogeneity analysis using the advanced penaliztaion techniques, can provide informative summary and graphical presentation, and is efficient and friendly.",
