                "abstract": "Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs) are integrated in bacterial genomes and key elements that drive prokaryote genome evolution. Among them are Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) and Integrative Mobilizable Elements (IMEs) which are important for bacterial fitness since they frequently carry genes participating in important bacterial adaptation phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance, virulence or specialized metabolic pathways. Although ICEs and IMEs are widespread, they are as yet almost never annotated in public bacterial genomes. To address the need of dedicated strategies for the annotation of these elements, we developed ICEscreen, a tool that introduces two new features to detect ICEs and IMEs in Firmicute genomes. First, ICEscreen uses an efficient strategy to detect Signature Proteins of ICEs and IMEs based on a database dedicated to Firmicutes and composed of manually curated proteins and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) profiles. Second, ICEscreen includes a new original algorithm that detects composite structures of ICEs and IMEs that are frequent in genomes of Firmicutes but are currently not resolved by any other tool. We benchmarked ICEscreen on experimentally supported elements and on a public dataset of 246 manually annotated elements including the genomes of 40 Firmicutes and demonstrate its efficiency to detect ICEs and IMEs.",
