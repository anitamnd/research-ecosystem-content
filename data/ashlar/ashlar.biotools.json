We used tissue cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) to generate fluorescence images which we artifact corrected using the BaSiC tool, stitched and registered using the ASHLAR algorithm, and segmented using ilastik software and MATLAB. We extracted single-cell features from these images using HistoCAT software. The resulting dataset can be visualized using image browsers and analyzed using high-dimensional, single-cell methods. This dataset is a valuable resource for biological discovery of the immune system in normal and diseased states as well as for the development of multiplexed image analysis and viewing tools.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Stitching microscope images into a mosaic is an essential step in the analysis and visualization of large biological specimens, particularly human and animal tissues. Recent approaches to highly multiplexed imaging generate high-plex data from sequential rounds of lower-plex imaging. These multiplexed imaging methods promise to yield precise molecular single-cell data and information on cellular neighborhoods and tissue architecture. However, attaining mosaic images with single-cell accuracy requires robust image stitching and image registration capabilities that are not met by existing methods. Results: We describe the development and testing of ASHLAR, a Python tool for coordinated stitching and registration of 103 or more individual multiplexed images to generate accurate whole-slide mosaics. ASHLAR reads image formats from most commercial microscopes and slide scanners, and we show that it performs better than existing open-source and commercial software. ASHLAR outputs standard OME-TIFF images that are ready for analysis by other open-source tools and recently developed image analysis pipelines.
