                "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical molecular mechanisms that regulate protein functions temporally and spatially in various organisms. Since most PTMs are dynamically regulated, quantifying PTM events under different states is crucial for understanding biological processes and diseases. With the rapid development of high-throughput proteomics technologies, massive quantitative PTM proteome datasets have been generated. Thus, a comprehensive one-stop data resource for surfing big data will benefit the community. Here, we updated our previous phosphorylation dynamics database qPhos to the qPTM (http://qptm.omicsbio.info). In qPTM, 11 482 553 quantification events among six types of PTMs, including phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation in four different organisms were collected and integrated, and the matched proteome datasets were included if available. The raw mass spectrometry based false discovery rate control and the recurrences of identifications among datasets were integrated into a scoring system to assess the reliability of the PTM sites. Browse and search functions were improved to facilitate users in swiftly and accurately acquiring specific information. The results page was revised with more abundant annotations, and time-course dynamics data were visualized in trend lines. We expected the qPTM database to be a much more powerful and comprehensive data repository for the PTM research community.",
