                "abstract": "Acute inflammation is a protective reaction by the immune system in response to invading pathogens or tissue damage. Ideally, the response should be localized, self-limited, and returning to homeostasis. If not resolved, acute inflammation can result in organ pathologies leading to chronic inflammatory phenotypes. Acute inflammation and inflammation resolution are complex coordinated processes, involving a number of cell types, interacting in space and time. The biomolecular complexity and the fact that several biomedical fields are involved, make a multi- and interdisciplinary approach necessary. The Atlas of Inflammation Resolution (AIR) is a web-based resource capturing an essential part of the state-of-the-art in acute inflammation and inflammation resolution research. The AIR provides an interface for users to search thousands of interactions, arranged in inter-connected multi-layers of process diagrams, covering a wide range of clinically relevant phenotypes. By mapping experimental data onto the AIR, it can be used to elucidate drug action as well as molecular mechanisms underlying different disease phenotypes. For the visualization and exploration of information, the AIR uses the Minerva platform, which is a well-established tool for the presentation of disease maps. The molecular details of the AIR are encoded using international standards. The AIR was created as a freely accessible resource, supporting research and education in the fields of acute inflammation and inflammation resolution. The AIR connects research communities, facilitates clinical decision making, and supports research scientists in the formulation and validation of hypotheses. The AIR is accessible through https://air.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de",
