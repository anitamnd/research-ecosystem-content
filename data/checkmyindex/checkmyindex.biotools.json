    "description": "When sequencing several libraries simultaneously, the selection of compatible combinations of indexes is critical for ensuring that the sequencer will be able to decipher the short, sample-specific barcodes added to each fragment. However, researchers have few tools to help them choose optimal indexes. Here, we present checkMyIndex, an online R/Shiny application that facilitates the selection of the right indexes as a function of the experimental constraints.",
