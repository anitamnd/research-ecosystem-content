    "description": "Ribbon is an interactive web visualization tool for viewing genomic alignments of short/long reads or assembled contigs to any reference genome.\n\nMake Ribbon automatically go to each variant in a bedpe file and take pictures of the multi-read view and a selection of reads. Instructions: Load a bedpe file and a bam file first, set the settings below and in the right-side panel as you want them and click Run!.\n\nMargin around a variant or manually entered coordinate where reads will be pulled from a bam file (use this parameter carefully as importing too much data can crash your web browser due to memory overload).",

Ribbon was born out of a need to curate complex structural variant calls and determine whether each was well supported by long-read evidence, and it uses the same intuitive visualization method to shed light on contig alignments from genome-to-genome comparisons.",
