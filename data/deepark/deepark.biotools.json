    "description": "DeepArk is a set of models of the worm, fish, fly, and mouse regulatory codes. For each of these organism, we constructed a deep convolutional neural network that predict regulatory activities (i.e. histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state) directly from genomic sequences. Besidese accurately predicting a sequence's regulatory activity, DeepArk can predict the effects of variants on regulatory function and profile sequences regulatory potential with in silico saturated mutagenesis.",

DeepArk accurately predicts the presence of thousands of different context-specific regulatory features, including chromatin states, histone marks, and transcription factors. In vivo studies show that DeepArk can predict the regulatory impact of any genomic variant (including rare or not previously observed) and enables the regulatory annotation of understudied model species.",
