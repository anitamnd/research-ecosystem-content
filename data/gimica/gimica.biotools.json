                "abstract": "Besides the environmental factors having tremendous impacts on the composition of microbial community, the host factors have recently gained extensive attentions on their roles in shaping human microbiota. There are two major types of host factors: host genetic factors (HGFs) and host immune factors (HIFs). These factors of each type are essential for defining the chemical and physical landscapes inhabited by microbiota, and the collective consideration of both types have great implication to serve comprehensive health management. However, no database was available to provide the comprehensive factors of both types. Herein, a database entitled 'Host Genetic and Immune Factors Shaping Human Microbiota (GIMICA)' was constructed. Based on the 4257 microbes confirmed to inhabit nine sites of human body, 2851 HGFs (1368 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 186 copy number variations (CNVs), and 1297 non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs)) modulating the expression of 370 microbes were collected, and 549 HIFs (126 lymphocytes and phagocytes, 387 immune proteins, and 36 immune pathways) regulating the abundance of 455 microbes were also provided. All in all, GIMICA enabled the collective consideration not only between different types of host factor but also between the host and environmental ones, which is freely accessible without login requirement at: https://idrblab.org/gimica/.",
