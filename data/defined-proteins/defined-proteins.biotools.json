                "abstract": "The rational design of proteins with desired functions requires a comprehensive description of the functional building blocks. The evolutionary conserved functional units constitute nature's toolbox; however, they are not readily available to protein designers. This study focuses on protein units of subdomain size that possess structural properties and amino acid residues sufficient to carry out elementary reactions in the catalytic mechanisms. The interactions within such elementary functional loops (ELFs) and the interactions with the surrounding protein scaffolds constitute the descriptor of elementary function. The computational approach to deriving descriptors directly from protein sequences and structures and applying them in rational design was implemented in a proof-of-concept DEFINED-PROTEINS software package. Once the descriptor is obtained, the ELF can be fitted into existing or novel scaffolds to obtain the desired function. For instance, the descriptor may be used to determine the necessary spatial restraints in a fragment-based grafting protocol. We illustrated the approach by applying it to well-known cases of ELFs, including phosphate-binding P-loop, diphosphate-binding glycine-rich motif, and calcium-binding EF-hand motif, which could be used to jumpstart templates for user applications. The DEFINED-PROTEINS package is available for free at https://github.com/MelvinYin/Defined_Proteins.",
