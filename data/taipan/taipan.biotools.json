    "description": "Taipan uses greedy extensions for contig construction but at each step realizes enough of the corresponding read graph to make better decisions as to how assembly should continue. We show that this approach can achieve an assembly quality at least as good as the graph-based approaches used in the popular Edena and Velvet assembly tools using a moderate amount of computing resources.",
