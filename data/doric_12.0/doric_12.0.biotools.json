                "abstract": "DoriC was first launched in 2007 as a database of replication origins (oriCs) in bacterial genomes and has since been constantly updated to integrate the latest research progress in this field. The database was subsequently extended to include the oriCs in archaeal genomes as well as those in plasmids. This latest release, DoriC 12.0, includes the oriCs in both draft and complete prokaryotic genomes. At the same time, the number of oriCs in the database has also increased significantly and currently contains over 200 000 bacterial entries distributed in more than 40 phyla. Among them, a large number are from bacteria in new phyla whose oriCs were not explored before. Additionally, new oriC features and improvements have been introduced, especially in the visualization and analysis of oriCs. Currently, DoriC is considered as an important database in the fields of bioinformatics, microbial genomics, and even synthetic biology, providing a valuable resource as well as a comprehensive platform for the research on oriCs. DoriC 12.0 can be accessed at https://tubic.org/doric/ and http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/.",
