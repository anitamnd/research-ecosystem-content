                "abstract": "Recent technological advances have enabled the generation of large amounts of data consisting of RNA sequences and their functional activity. Here, we propose a method for extracting secondary structure features that affect the functional activity of RNA from sequence-activity data. Given pairs of RNA sequences and their corresponding bioactivity values, our method calculates position-specific structural features of the input RNA sequences, considering every possible secondary structure of each RNA. A Ridge regression model is trained using the structural features as feature vectors and the bioactivity values as response variables. Optimized model parameters indicate how secondary structure features affect bioactivity. We used our method to extract intramolecular structural features of bacterial translation initiation sites and self-cleaving ribozymes, and the intermolecular features between rRNAs and Shine-Dalgarno sequences and between U1 RNAs and splicing sites. We not only identified known structural features but also revealed more detailed insights into structure-activity relationships than previously reported. Importantly, the datasets we analyzed here were obtained from different experimental systems and differed in size, sequence length and similarity, and number of RNA molecules involved, demonstrating that our method is applicable to various types of data consisting of RNA sequences and bioactivity values.",
