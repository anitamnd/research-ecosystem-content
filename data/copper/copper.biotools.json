                "abstract": "Antiviral defenses are one of the significant roles of RNA interference (RNAi) in plants. It has been reported that the host RNAi mechanism machinery can target viral RNAs for destruction because virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) are found in infected host cells. Therefore, the recognition of plant vsiRNAs is the key to understanding the functional mechanisms of vsiRNAs and developing antiviral plants. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based stacking ensemble approach, named computational prediction of plant exclusive virus-derived small interfering RNAs (COPPER), for plant vsiRNA prediction. COPPER used word2vec and fastText to generate sequence features and a hybrid deep learning framework, including a convolutional neural network, multiscale residual network and bidirectional long short-term memory network with a self-attention mechanism to enable precise predictions of plant vsiRNAs. Extensive benchmarking experiments with different sequence homology thresholds and ablation studies illustrated the comparative predictive performance of COPPER. In addition, the performance comparison with PVsiRNAPred conducted on an independent test dataset showed that COPPER significantly improved the predictive performance for plant vsiRNAs compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The datasets and source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyuanbu/COPPER.",
