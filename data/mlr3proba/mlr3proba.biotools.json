It currently supports the following tasks:.\n\nProbabilistic Supervised Learning for mlr3.\n\nCore learners are implemented in mlr3proba, recommended common learners are implemented in mlr3learners, and many more are implemented in mlr3extralearners. Use the interactive search table to search for available learners and see the learner status page for their live status.",

                "abstract": "As machine learning has become increasingly popular over the last few decades, so too has the number of machine-learning interfaces for implementing these models. Whilst many R libraries exist for machine learning, very few offer extended support for survival analysis. This is problematic considering its importance in fields like medicine, bioinformatics, economics, engineering and more. mlr3proba provides a comprehensive machine-learning interface for survival analysis and connects with mlr3's general model tuning and benchmarking facilities to provide a systematic infrastructure for survival modelling and evaluation.",
