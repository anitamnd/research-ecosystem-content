    "description": "Recognition of small molecule-RNA binding sites using RNA sequence and structure.\n\nRNA-ligand binding sites prediction.\n\nRNAsite is a novel method to predict small molecule-RNA binding sites. We first developed a structure-based method (RNAsite_str) by designing a group of novel structure-based features that effectively captured the perferences towards small molecule-RNA binding sites. Second, a sequence profile-based predictor (RNAsite_seq) was designed to deal with the cases where no structure is available. These two methods are combined, yielding to the final approach RNAsite.

                "abstract": "Motivation: RNA molecules become attractive small molecule drug targets to treat disease in recent years. Computer-aided drug design can be facilitated by detecting the RNA sites that bind small molecules. However, very limited progress has been reported for the prediction of small molecule-RNA binding sites. Results: We developed a novel method RNAsite to predict small molecule-RNA binding sites using sequence profile- and structure-based descriptors. RNAsite was shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art methods on the experimental structures of two independent test sets. When predicted structure models were used, RNAsite outperforms other methods by a large margin. The possibility of improving RNAsite by geometry-based binding pocket detection was investigated. The influence of RNA structure's flexibility and the conformational changes caused by ligand binding on RNAsite were also discussed. RNAsite is anticipated to be a useful tool for the design of RNA-targeting small molecule drugs.",
