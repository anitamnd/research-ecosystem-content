                "abstract": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) play a central role in sustaining all forms of life through the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates. Despite significant strides made in recent years to establish computational resources, databases and tools to understand the nature and role of carbohydrates and related glycoenzymes, a data analytics framework that connects the sequence-structure-function relationships to the evolution of GTs is currently lacking. This hinders the characterization of understudied GTs and the synthetic design of GTs for medical and biotechnology applications. Here, we present GTXplorer as an integrated platform that presents evolutionary information of GTs adopting a GT-A fold in an intuitive format enabling in silico investigation through comparative sequence analysis to derive informed hypotheses about their function. The tree view mode provides an overview of the evolutionary relationships of GT-A families and allows users to select phylogenetically relevant families for comparisons. The selected families can then be compared in the alignment view at the residue level using annotated weblogo stacks of the GT-A core specific to the selected clade, family, or subfamily. All data are easily accessible and can be downloaded for further analysis. GTXplorer can be accessed at https://vulcan.cs.uga.edu/gtxplorer/ or from GitHub at https://github.com/esbgkannan/GTxplorer to deploy locally. By packaging multiple data streams into an accessible, user-friendly format, GTXplorer presents the first evolutionary data analytics platform for comparative glycomics.",
