                "abstract": "The human upper respiratory tract is the reservoir of a diverse community of commensals and potential pathogens (pathobionts), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, which occasionally turn into pathogens causing infectious diseases, while the contribution of many nasal microorganisms to human health remains undiscovered. To better understand the composition of the nasal microbiome community, we create a workflow of the community model, which mimics the human nasal environment. To address this challenge, constraint-based reconstruction of biochemically accurate genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) networks of microorganisms is mandatory. Our workflow applies constraint-based modeling (CBM), simulates the metabolism between species in a given microbiome, and facilitates generating novel hypotheses on microbial interactions. Utilizing this workflow, we hope to gain a better understanding of interactions from the metabolic modeling perspective. This article presents nasal community modeling workflow (NCMW)—a python package based on GEMs of species as a starting point for understanding the composition of the nasal microbiome community. The package is constructed as a step-by-step mathematical framework for metabolic modeling and analysis of the nasal microbial community. Using constraint-based models reduces the need for culturing species in vitro, a process that is not convenient in the environment of human noses. Availability: NCMW is freely available on the Python Package Index (PIP) via pip install NCMW.
