                "abstract": "Multiplex amplicon sequencing is a versatile method to identify genetic variation in natural or mutagenized populations through eco-tilling or multiplex CRISPR screens. Such genotyping screens require reliable and specific primer designs, combined with simultaneous gRNA design for CRISPR screens. Unfortunately, current tools are unable to combine multiplex gRNA and primer design in a high-throughput and easy-to-use manner with high design flexibility. Here, we report the development of a bioinformatics tool called SMAP design to overcome these limitations. We tested SMAP design on several plant and non-plant genomes and obtained designs for more than 80â€“90% of the target genes, depending on the genome and gene family. We validated the designs with Illumina multiplex amplicon sequencing and Sanger sequencing in Arabidopsis, soybean, and maize. We also used SMAP design to perform eco-tilling by tilling PCR amplicons across nine candidate genes putatively associated with haploid induction in Cichorium intybus. We screened 60 accessions of chicory and witloof and identified thirteen knockout haplotypes and their carriers. SMAP design is an easy-to-use command-line tool that generates highly specific gRNA and/or primer designs for any number of loci for CRISPR or natural variation screens and is compatible with other SMAP modules for seamless downstream analysis.",
