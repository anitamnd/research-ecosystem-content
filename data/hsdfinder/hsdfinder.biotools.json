                "abstract": "Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism capable of providing new genetic material for adaptive and nonadaptive evolution. However, bioinformatics tools for identifying duplicate genes are often limited to the detection of paralogs in multiple species or to specific types of gene duplicates, such as retrocopies. Here, we present a user-friendly, BLAST-based web tool, called HSDFinder, which can identify, annotate, categorize, and visualize highly similar duplicate genes (HSDs) in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. HSDFinder includes an online heatmap plotting option, allowing users to compare HSDs among different species and visualize the results in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway functional categories. The external software requirements are BLAST, InterProScan, and KEGG. The utility of HSDFinder was tested on various model eukaryotic species, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays as well as the psychrophilic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241, and was proven to be a practical and accurate tool for gene duplication analyses. The web tool is free to use at http://hsdfinder.com.
