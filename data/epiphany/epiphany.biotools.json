                "abstract": "Antibodies are critical effector molecules of the humoral immune system. Upon infection or vaccination, populations of antibodies are generated which bind to various regions of the invading pathogen or exogenous agent. Defining the reactivity and breadth of this antibody response provides an understanding of the antigenic determinants and enables the rational development and assessment of vaccine candidates. High-resolution analysis of these populations typically requires advanced techniques such as B cell receptor repertoire sequencing, mass spectrometry of isolated immunoglobulins, or phage display libraries that are dependent upon equipment and expertise which are prohibitive for many labs. High-density peptide microarrays representing diverse populations of putative linear epitopes (immunoarrays) are an effective alternative for high-throughput examination of antibody reactivity and diversity. While a promising technology, widespread adoption of immunoarrays has been limited by the need for, and relative absence of, user-friendly tools for consideration and visualization of the emerging data. To address this limitation, we developed EPIphany, a software platform with a simple web-based user interface, aimed at biological users, that provides access to important analysis parameters, data normalization options, and a variety of unique data visualization options. This platform provides researchers the greatest opportunity to extract biologically meaningful information from the immunoarray data, thereby facilitating the discovery and development of novel immuno-therapeutics.",
