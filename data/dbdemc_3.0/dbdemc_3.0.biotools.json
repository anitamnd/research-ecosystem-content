                "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators in gene expression. The dysregulation of miRNA expression is widely reported in the transformation from physiological to pathological states of cells. A large number of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) have been identified in various human cancers by using high-throughput technologies, such as microarray and miRNA-seq. Through mining of published studies with high-throughput experiment information, the database of DEMs in human cancers (dbDEMC) was constructed with the aim of providing a systematic resource for the storage and query of the DEMs. Here we report an update of the dbDEMC to version 3.0, which contains two-fold more data entries than the second version and now includes also data from mice and rats. The dbDEMC 3.0 contains 3268 unique DEMs in 40 different cancer types. The current datasets for differential expression analysis have expanded to 9 generalized categories. Moreover, the current release integrates functional annotations of DEMs obtained by using experimentally validated targets. The annotations can be of great benefit to the intensive analysis of the roles of DEMs in cancer. In summary, dbDEMC 3.0 provides a valuable resource for characterizing molecular functions and regulatory mechanisms of DEMs in human cancers. The dbDEMC 3.0 is freely accessible at https://www.biosino.org/dbDEMC.",
