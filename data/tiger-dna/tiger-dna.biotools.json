                "abstract": "Motivation: Genomic DNA replicates according to a reproducible spatiotemporal program, with some loci replicating early in S phase while others replicate late. Despite being a central cellular process, DNA replication timing studies have been limited in scale due to technical challenges. Results: We present TIGER (Timing Inferred from Genome Replication), a computational approach for extracting DNA replication timing information from whole genome sequence data obtained from proliferating cell samples. The presence of replicating cells in a biological specimen leads to non-uniform representation of genomic DNA that depends on the timing of replication of different genomic loci. Replication dynamics can hence be observed in genome sequence data by analyzing DNA copy number along chromosomes while accounting for other sources of sequence coverage variation. TIGER is applicable to any species with a contiguous genome assembly and rivals the quality of experimental measurements of DNA replication timing. It provides a straightforward approach for measuring replication timing and can readily be applied at scale.",
