To aid with the selection of structure models and further inform the development of structure prediction techniques, we describe the ResiRole method for the assessment of the quality of structure models. Results: Structure prediction techniques are ranked according to the results of round-robin, head-to-head comparisons using difference scores. Each difference score was defined as the absolute value of the cumulative probability for a functional site prediction made with the FEATURE program for the reference structure minus that for the structure model. Overall, the difference scores correlate well with other model quality metrics; and based on benchmarking studies with Na√ØveBLAST, they are found to detect additional local structural similarities between the structure models and reference structures.",
