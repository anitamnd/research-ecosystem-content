                "abstract": "Advances in imaging, segmentation and tracking have led to the routine generation of large and complex microscopy datasets. New tools are required to process this ‘phenomics’ type data. Here, we present ‘Cell PLasticity Analysis Tool’ (cellPLATO), a Python-based analysis software designed for measurement and classification of cell behaviours based on clustering features of cell morphology and motility. Used after segmentation and tracking, the tool extracts features from each cell per timepoint, using them to segregate cells into dimensionally reduced behavioural subtypes. Resultant cell tracks describe a ‘behavioural ID’ at each timepoint, and similarity analysis allows the grouping of behavioural sequences into discrete trajectories with assigned IDs. Here, we use cellPLATO to investigate the role of IL-15 in modulating human natural killer (NK) cell migration on ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. We find eight behavioural subsets of NK cells based on their shape and migration dynamics between single timepoints, and four trajectories based on sequences of these behaviours over time. Therefore, by using cellPLATO, we show that IL-15 increases plasticity between cell migration behaviours and that different integrin ligands induce different forms of NK cell migration.",
