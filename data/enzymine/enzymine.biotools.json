                "abstract": "Addition of chemical structural information in enzymatic reactions has proven to be significant for accurate enzyme function prediction. However, such chemical data lack systematic feature mining and hardly exist in enzyme-related databases. Therefore, global mining of enzymatic reactions will offer a unique landscape for researchers to understand the basic functional mechanisms of natural bioprocesses and facilitate enzyme function annotation. Here, we established a new knowledge base called EnzyMine, through which we propose to elucidate enzymatic reaction features and then link them with sequence and structural annotations. EnzyMine represents an advanced database that extends enzyme knowledge by incorporating reaction chemical feature strategies, strengthening the connectivity between enzyme and metabolic reactions. Therefore, it has the potential to reveal many new metabolic pathways involved with given enzymes, as well as expand enzyme function annotation. Database URL: http://www.rxnfinder.org/enzymine/.",
