    "description": "Building blocks for efficient handling of large Hi-C datasets.\n\nFramework for Storing and Accessing Hi-C Data Through HDF Files.\n\nHiCBricks is a library designed for handling large high-resolution Hi-C datasets. Over the years, the Hi-C field has experienced a rapid increase in the size and complexity of datasets. HiCBricks is meant to overcome the challenges related to the analysis of such large datasets within the R environment. HiCBricks offers user-friendly and efficient solutions for handling large high-resolution Hi-C datasets. The package provides an R/Bioconductor framework with the bricks to build more complex data analysis pipelines and algorithms. HiCBricks already incorporates example algorithms for calling domain boundaries and functions for high quality data visualization",
