                "abstract": "Analyzing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences allows researchers to elucidate the prokaryotic composition of an environment. In recent years, third-generation sequencing technology has provided opportunities for researchers to perform full-length sequence analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA. RDP, SILVA, and Greengenes are the most widely used 16S rRNA databases. Many 16S rRNA classifiers have used these databases as a reference for taxonomic assignment tasks. However, some of the prokaryotic taxonomies only exist in one of the three databases. Furthermore, Greengenes and SILVA include a considerable number of taxonomies that do not have the resolution to the species level, which has limited the classifiersâ€™ performance. In order to improve the accuracy of taxonomic assignment at the species level for full-length 16S rRNA sequences, we manually curated the three databases and removed the sequences that did not have a species name. We then established a taxonomy-based integrated database by considering both taxonomies and sequences from all three 16S rRNA databases and validated it by a mock community. Results showed that our taxonomy-based integrated database had improved taxonomic resolution to the species level. The integrated database and the related datasets are available at https://github.com/yphsieh/ItgDB.",
