                "abstract": "Motivation: Characterizing all steady-state flux distributions in metabolic models remains limited to small models due to the explosion of possibilities. Often it is sufficient to look only at all possible overall conversions a cell can catalyze ignoring the details of intracellular metabolism. Such a characterization is achieved by elementary conversion modes (ECMs), which can be conveniently computed with ecmtool. However, currently, ecmtool is memory intensive, and it cannot be aided appreciably by parallelization. Results: We integrate mplrs - a scalable parallel vertex enumeration method - into ecmtool. This speeds up computation, drastically reduces memory requirements and enables ecmtool's use in standard and high-performance computing environments. We show the new capabilities by enumerating all feasible ECMs of the near-complete metabolic model of the minimal cell JCVI-syn3.0. Despite the cell's minimal character, the model gives rise to 4.2×109 ECMs and still contains several redundant sub-networks.",
