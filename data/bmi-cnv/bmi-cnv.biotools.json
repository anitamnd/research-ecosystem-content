                "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) enables the detection of copy number variants (CNVs) with high resolution in protein-coding regions. However, variants in the intergenic or intragenic regions are excluded from studies. Fortunately, many of these samples have been previously sequenced by other genotyping platforms which are sparse but cover a wide range of genomic regions, such as SNP array. Moreover, conventional single sample-based methods suffer from a high false discovery rate due to prominent data noise. Therefore, methods for integrating multiple genotyping platforms and multiple samples are highly demanded for improved copy number variant detection. We developed BMI-CNV, a Bayesian Multisample and Integrative CNV (BMI-CNV) profiling method with data sequenced by both whole-exome sequencing and microarray. For the multisample integration, we identify the shared copy number variants regions across samples using a Bayesian probit stick-breaking process model coupled with a Gaussian Mixture model estimation. With extensive simulations, BMI-copy number variant outperformed existing methods with improved accuracy. In the matched data from the 1000 Genomes Project and HapMap project data, BMI-CNV also accurately detected common variants and significantly enlarged the detection spectrum of whole-exome sequencing. Further application to the data from The Research of International Cancer of Lung consortium (TRICL) identified lung cancer risk variant candidates in 17q11.2, 1p36.12, 8q23.1, and 5q22.2 regions.",
