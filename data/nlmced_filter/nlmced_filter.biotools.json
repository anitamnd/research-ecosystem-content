These images are infected by Rician noise which is a non-Additive noise, allows to reduce the image contrast and causes random fluctuations. Our paper proposed a new method for 3D MRI denoising based on new combination between non-local means filter and the diffusion tensor with adaptative MAD estimator Rician noise. The performance of our proposed algorithm was evaluated with respect to different quantitative measures, compared to other denoising methods which illustrate that our proposed denoising algorithm efficiently removes noise and preserves more details.",
