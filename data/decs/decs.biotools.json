                "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex and dynamic cellular mechanisms. However, cell type annotation remains a main challenge as it largely relies on a priori knowledge and manual curation, which is cumbersome and subjective. The increasing number of scRNA-seq datasets, as well as numerous published genetic studies, has motivated us to build a comprehensive human cell type reference atlas. Here, we present decoding Cell type Specificity (deCS), an automatic cell type annotation method augmented by a comprehensive collection of human cell type expression profiles and marker genes. We used deCS to annotate scRNA-seq data from various tissue types and systematically evaluated the annotation accuracy under different conditions, including reference panels, sequencing depth, and feature selection strategies. Our results demonstrate that expanding the references is critical for improving annotation accuracy. Compared to many existing state-of-the-art annotation tools, deCS significantly reduced computation time and increased accuracy. deCS can be integrated into the standard scRNA-seq analytical pipeline to enhance cell type annotation. Finally, we demonstrated the broad utility of deCS to identify traitâ€“cell type associations in 51 human complex traits, providing deep insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. All documents for deCS, including source code, user manual, demo data, and tutorials, are freely available at https://github.com/bsml320/deCS.",
