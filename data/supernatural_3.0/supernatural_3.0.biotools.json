                "abstract": "Natural products (NPs) are single chemical compounds, substances or mixtures produced by a living organism - found in nature. Evolutionarily, NPs have been used as healing agents since thousands of years and still today continue to be the most important source of new potential therapeutic preparations. Natural products have played a key role in modern drug discovery for several diseases. Furthermore, following consumers' increasing demand for natural food ingredients, many efforts have been made to discover natural low-calorie sweeteners in recent years. SuperNatural 3.0 is a freely available database of natural products and derivatives. The updated version contains 449 058 natural compounds along with their structural and physicochemical information. Additionally, information on pathways, mechanism of action, toxicity, vendor information if available, drug-like chemical space prediction for several diseases as antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, anticancer, and target specific cells like the central nervous system (CNS) are also provided for the natural compounds. The updated version of the database also provides a valuable pool of natural compounds in which potential highly sweet compounds are expected to be found. The possible taste profile of the natural compounds was predicted using our published VirtualTaste models.",
