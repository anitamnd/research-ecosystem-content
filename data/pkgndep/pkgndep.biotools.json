                "abstract": "Summary: Numerous R packages have been developed for bioinformatics analysis in the last decade and dependencies among packages have become critical issues to consider. In this work, we proposed a new metric named dependency heaviness that measures the number of dependencies that a parent uniquely brings to a package and we proposed possible solutions for reducing the complexity of dependencies by optimizing the use of heavy parents. We implemented the metric in a new R package pkgndep which provides an intuitive way for dependency heaviness analysis. Based on pkgndep, we additionally performed a global analysis of dependency heaviness on CRAN and Bioconductor ecosystems and we revealed top packages that have significant contributions of high dependency heaviness to their child packages.",
