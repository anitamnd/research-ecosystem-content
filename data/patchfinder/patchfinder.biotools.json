            "note": "An algorithmic tool for the identification of functionally important regions in proteins with known three-dimentional (3D) structure. The algorithm is based on the observation that evolutionarily conserved regions are often functionally important and based on the following three steps:1. Assignment of an evolutionary conservation score for each position in the protein (using ConSurf).2. Extraction of solvent accessible residues in the protein. This step is aimed on eliminating residues which are conserved due to structural constrains and are typically buried in the protein core.3. Identification of the most significant cluster of conserved residues on the proteins' surface. This ML-patch is suspected to be the main functional site of the protein.After the ML-patch was found the search procedure is continued for non-overlapping secondary functional sites with weaker conservation signal.PatchFinder was examined on a dataset of 110 protein structures with annotated functional sites resid",
