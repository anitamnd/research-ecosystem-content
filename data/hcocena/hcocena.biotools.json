                "abstract": "Motivation: Transcriptome-based gene co-expression analysis has become a standard procedure for structured and contextualized understanding and comparison of different conditions and phenotypes. Since large study designs with a broad variety of conditions are costly and laborious, extensive comparisons are hindered when utilizing only a single dataset. Thus, there is an increased need for tools that allow the integration of multiple transcriptomic datasets with subsequent joint analysis, which can provide a more systematic understanding of gene co-expression and co-functionality within and across conditions. To make such an integrative analysis accessible to a wide spectrum of users with differing levels of programming expertise it is essential to provide user-friendliness and customizability as well as thorough documentation. Results: This article introduces horizontal CoCena (hCoCena: horizontal construction of co-expression networks and analysis), an R-package for network-based co-expression analysis that allows the analysis of a single transcriptomic dataset as well as the joint analysis of multiple datasets. With hCoCena, we provide a freely available, user-friendly and adaptable tool for integrative multi-study or single-study transcriptomics analyses alongside extensive comparisons to other existing tools.",
