                "abstract": "Motivation: Molecular property prediction is a hot topic in recent years. Existing graph-based models ignore the hierarchical structures of molecules. According to the knowledge of chemistry and pharmacy, the functional groups of molecules are closely related to its physio-chemical properties and binding affinities. So, it should be helpful to represent molecular graphs by fragments that contain functional groups for molecular property prediction. Results: In this article, to boost the performance of molecule property prediction, we first propose a definition of molecule graph fragments that may be or contain functional groups, which are relevant to molecular properties, then develop a fragment-oriented multi-scale graph attention network for molecular property prediction, which is called FraGAT. Experiments on several widely used benchmarks are conducted to evaluate FraGAT. Experimental results show that FraGAT achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance in most cases. Furthermore, our case studies show that when the fragments used to represent the molecule graphs contain functional groups, the model can make better predictions. This conforms to our expectation and demonstrates the interpretability of the proposed model.",
