                "abstract": "Chemical mutagenicity is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in early drug discovery. Over a long period of time, medicinal chemists have manually summarized a series of empirical rules for the optimization of chemical mutagenicity. However, given the rising amount of data, it is getting more difficult for medicinal chemists to identify more comprehensive chemical rules behind the biochemical data. Herein, we integrated a large Ames mutagenicity data set with 8576 compounds to derive mutagenicity transformation rules for reversing Ames mutagenicity via matched molecular pairs analysis. A well-trained consensus model with a reasonable applicability domain was constructed, which showed favorable performance in the external validation set with an accuracy of 0.815. The model was used to assess the generalizability and validity of these mutagenicity transformation rules. The results demonstrated that these rules were of great value and could provide inspiration for the structural modifications of compounds with potential mutagenic effects. We also found that the local chemical environment of the attachment points of rules was critical for successful transformation. To facilitate the use of these mutagenicity transformation rules, we integrated them into ADMETopt2 (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/admetopt2/), a free web server for optimization of chemical ADMET properties. The above-mentioned approach would be extended to the optimization of other toxicity endpoints. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",
