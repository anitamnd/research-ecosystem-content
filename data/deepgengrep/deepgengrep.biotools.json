                "abstract": "Motivation: Accurate annotation of different genomic signals and regions (GSRs) from DNA sequences is fundamentally important for understanding gene structure, regulation and function. Numerous efforts have been made to develop machine learning-based predictors for in silico identification of GSRs. However, it remains a great challenge to identify GSRs as the performance of most existing approaches is unsatisfactory. As such, it is highly desirable to develop more accurate computational methods for GSRs prediction. Results: In this study, we propose a general deep learning framework termed DeepGenGrep, a general predictor for the systematic identification of multiple different GSRs from genomic DNA sequences. DeepGenGrep leverages the power of hybrid neural networks comprising a three-layer convolutional neural network and a two-layer long short-term memory to effectively learn useful feature representations from sequences. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate that DeepGenGrep outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on identifying polyadenylation signals, translation initiation sites and splice sites across four eukaryotic species including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Bos taurus and Drosophila melanogaster. Overall, DeepGenGrep represents a useful tool for the high-throughput and cost-effective identification of potential GSRs in eukaryotic genomes.
