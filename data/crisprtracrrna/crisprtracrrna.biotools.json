                "abstract": "Motivation: The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a Type II CRISPR system that has rapidly become the most versatile and widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems. Results: We introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline combines evidence from different components of the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural model via covariance models from a sequence-structure alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNAâ€“RNA interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 50-part of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based approach (CRISPRidenify). Providing further evidence, we detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (Type II CRISPR systems) and Cas12 (Type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for Type V systems.
