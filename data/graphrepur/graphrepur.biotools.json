                "abstract": "Motivation: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women worldwide. It is necessary to develop new breast cancer drugs because of the shortcomings of existing therapies. The traditional discovery process is time-consuming and expensive. Repositioning of clinically approved drugs has emerged as a novel approach for breast cancer therapy. However, serendipitous or experiential repurposing cannot be used as a routine method. Results: In this study, we proposed a graph neural network model GraphRepur based on GraphSAGE for drug repurposing against breast cancer. GraphRepur integrated two major classes of computational methods, drug network-based and drug signature-based. The differentially expressed genes of disease, drug-exposure gene expression data and the drug-drug links information were collected. By extracting the drug signatures and topological structure information contained in the drug relationships, GraphRepur can predict new drugs for breast cancer, outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches and some classic machine learning methods. The high-ranked drugs have indeed been reported as new uses for breast cancer treatment recently.",
