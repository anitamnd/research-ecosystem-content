However, the FPM does not yet have an adequately capable open-source software. In order to fill this gap we are presenting novel, simple, universal, semi-automatic and highly intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) open-source application called the FPM app enabling wide-scale robust FPM reconstruction. Apart from implementing the FPM in accessible GUI app, we also made several improvements in the FPM image reconstruction process itself, making the FPM more automatic, noise-robust and faster.",
