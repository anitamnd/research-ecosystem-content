                "abstract": "Commitment to specific cell lineages is critical for mammalian embryonic development. Lineage determination, differentiation, maintenance, and organogenesis result in diverse life forms composed of multiple cell types. To understand the formation and maintenance of living individuals, including human beings, a comprehensive database that integrates multi-omic information underlying lineage differentiation across multiple species is urgently needed. Here, we construct Lineage Landscape, a database that compiles, analyzes and visualizes transcriptomic and epigenomic information related to lineage development in a collection of species. This landscape draws together datasets that capture the ongoing changes in cell lineages from classic model organisms to human beings throughout embryonic, fetal, adult, and aged stages, providing comprehensive, open-access information that is useful to researchers of a broad spectrum of life science disciplines. Lineage Landscape contains single-cell gene expression and bulk transcriptomic, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility profiles. Using this database, users can explore genes of interest that exhibit dynamic expression patterns at the transcriptional or epigenetic levels at different stages of lineage development. Lineage Landscape currently includes over 6.6 million cells, 15 million differentially expressed genes and 36 million data entries across 10 species and 34 organs. Lineage Landscape is free to access, browse, search, and download at http://data.iscr.ac.cn/lineage/#/home.",
