                "abstract": "Teleost fish represent one of the largest and most diverse clades of vertebrates, which makes them great models in various research areas such as ecology and evolution. Recent sequencing endeavors provided high-quality genomes for species covering the main fish evolutionary lineages, opening up large-scale comparative genomics studies. However, transcriptomic data across fish species and organs are heterogenous and have not been integrated with newly sequenced genomes making gene expression quantification and comparative analyses particularly challenging. Thus, resources integrating genomic and transcriptomic data across fish species and organs are still lacking. Here, we present FEVER, a web-based resource allowing evolutionary transcriptomics across species and tissues. First, based on query genes FEVER reconstructs gene trees providing orthologous and paralogous relationships as well as their evolutionary dynamics across 13 species covering the major fish lineages, and 4 model species as evolutionary outgroups. Second, it provides unbiased gene expression across 11 tissues using up-to-date fish genomes. Finally, genomic and transcriptomic data are combined together allowing the exploration of gene expression evolution following speciation and duplication events. FEVER is freely accessible at https://fever.sk8.inrae.fr/.",
