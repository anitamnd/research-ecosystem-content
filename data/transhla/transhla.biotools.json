    "description": "TransHLA is a tool designed to discern whether a peptide will be recognized by HLA as an epitope.TransHLA is the first tool capable of directly identifying peptides as epitopes without the need for inputting HLA alleles. Due the different length of epitopes, we trained two models. The first is TransHLA_I, which is used for the detection of the HLA-I epitope, the other is TransHLA_II, which is used for the detection of the HLA-II epitope.",
