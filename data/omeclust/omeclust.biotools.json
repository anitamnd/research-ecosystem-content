    "description": "omeClust is a clustering method that detects clusters of features using omics data and scores metadata (resolution score) based on their influences in clustering. The similarity of features within each cluster can be different (different resolution). Resolution of similarity score takes to account not only similarity between measurements and also the structure in a hierarchical structure of data and number of features which group together.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: The discovery of biologically interpretable and clinically actionable communities in heterogeneous omics data is a necessary first step toward deriving mechanistic insights into complex biological phenomena. Here, we present a novel clustering approach, omeClust, for community detection in omics profiles by simultaneously incorporating similarities among measurements and the overall complex structure of the data. Results: We show that omeClust outperforms published methods in inferring the true community structure as measured by both sensitivity and misclassification rate on simulated datasets. We further validated omeClust in diverse, multiple omics datasets, revealing new communities and functionally related groups in microbial strains, cell line gene expression patterns and fetal genomic variation. We also derived enrichment scores attributable to putatively meaningful biological factors in these datasets that can serve as hypothesis generators facilitating new sets of testable hypotheses.",
