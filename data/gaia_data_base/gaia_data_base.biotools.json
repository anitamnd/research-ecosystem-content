                "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4) are 3D structures that are found in both DNA and RNA. Interest in this structure has grown over the past few years due to both its implication in diverse biological mechanisms and its potential use as a therapeutic target, to name two examples. G4s in humans have been widely studied; however, the level of their study in other species remains relatively minimal. That said, progress in this field has resulted in the prediction of G4s structures in various species, ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes. These predictions were analysed in a previous study which revealed that G4s are present in all living kingdoms. To date, eleven different databases have grouped the various G4s depending on either their structures, on the proteins that might bind them, or on their location in the various genomes. However, none of these databases contains information on their location in the transcriptome of many of the implicated species. The GAIA database was designed so as to make this data available online in a user-friendly manner. Through its web interface, users can query GAIA to filter G4s, which, we hope, will help the research in this field. GAIA is available at: https://gaia.cobius.usherbrooke.ca",
