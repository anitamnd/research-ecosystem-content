                "abstract": "Multi-drug combinations for the treatment of complex diseases are gradually becoming an important treatment, and this type of treatment can take advantage of the synergistic effects among drugs. However, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are not just all beneficial. Accurate and rapid identifications of the DDIs are essential to enhance the effectiveness of combination therapy and avoid unintended side effects. Traditional DDIs prediction methods use only drug sequence information or drug graph information, which ignores information about the position of atoms and edges in the spatial structure. In this paper, we propose Molormer, a method based on a lightweight attention mechanism for DDIs prediction. Molormer takes the two-dimension (2D) structures of drugs as input and encodes the molecular graph with spatial information. Besides, Molormer uses lightweight-based attention mechanism and self-attention distilling to process spatially the encoded molecular graph, which not only retains the multi-headed attention mechanism but also reduces the computational and storage costs. Finally, we use the Siamese network architecture to serve as the architecture of Molormer, which can make full use of the limited data to train the model for better performance and also limit the differences to some extent between networks dealing with drug features. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 on multi-label DDIs dataset. In the case study section, we used Molormer to make predictions of new interactions for the drugs Aliskiren, Selexipag and Vorapaxar and validated parts of the predictions.
