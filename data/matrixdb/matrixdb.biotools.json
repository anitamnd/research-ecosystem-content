Only few databases report protein-polysaccharide interactions and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other database of extracellular interactions. MatrixDB takes into account the multimeric nature of several extracellular protein families for the curation of interactions, and reports interactionswith individual polypeptide chains or with multimers, considered as permanent complexes, when appropriate. MatrixDB is a member of the International Molecular Exchange consortium (IMEx) and has adopted the PSI-MI standards for the curation and the exchange of interaction data. MatrixDB stores experimental data from our laboratory, data from literature curation, data imported from IMEx databases, and data from the Human Protein Reference Database. MatrixDB is focused on mammalian interactions, but aims to integrate interaction datasets of model organisms when available. MatrixDB provides direct links to databases recapitulating mutations ingenes encoding extracellular proteins, to UniGene and to the Human Protein Atlas that shows expression and localization of proteins in a large variety of normal human tissues and cells. MatrixDB allows researchers to perform customized queries and to build tissue- and disease-specific interaction networks that can be visualized and analyzed with Cytoscape or Medusa.

MatrixDB content has been updated by curation and by importing extracellular interaction data fromother IMEx databases. Othermajor changes include the creation of a new website and the development of a novel graphical navigator, iNavigator, to build and expand interaction networks. Filters may be applied to build sub-networks based on a list of biomolecules, a specified interaction detection method and/or an expression level by tissue, developmental stage, and health state (UniGene data). Any molecule of the network may be selected and its partners added to the network at any time. Networks may be exported under Cytoscape and tabular formats and as images, and may be saved for subsequent re-use.",

It has adopted the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative standards for annotating and exchanging interaction data, either at the MIMIx (The Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction eXperiment) or IMEx level. The following items related to GAGs have been added in the updated version of MatrixDB: (i) cross-references of GAG sequences to the GlyTouCan database, (ii) representation of GAG sequences in different formats (IUPAC and GlycoCT) and as SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature For Glycans) images and (iii) the GAG Builder online tool to build 3D models of GAG sequences from GlycoCT codes. The database schema has been improved to represent n-Ary experiments. Gene expression data, imported from Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home), quantitative ECM proteomic datasets (http://matrisomeproject.mit.edu/ecm-Atlas), and a new visualization tool of the 3D structures of biomolecules, based on the PDB Component Library and LiteMol, have also been added. A new advanced query interface now allows users to mine MatrixDB data using combinations of criteria, in order to build specific interaction networks related to diseases, biological processes, molecular functions or publications.",
