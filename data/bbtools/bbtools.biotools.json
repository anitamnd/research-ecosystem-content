    "description": "BBTools is a suite of fast, multithreaded bioinformatics tools designed for analysis of DNA and RNA sequence data. BBTools can handle common sequencing file formats such as fastq, fasta, sam, scarf, fasta+qual, compressed or raw, with autodetection of quality encoding and interleaving. It is written in Java and works on any platform supporting Java, including Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows and Linux; there are no dependencies other than Java (version 7 or higher). Program descriptions and options are shown when running the shell scripts with no parameters.\n\nBBTools is open source and free for unlimited use, and is used regularly by DOE JGI and other institutions around the world.",
