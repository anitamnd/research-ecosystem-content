Exploratory data analysis at the level of individual subjects, when enhanced by interactive data visualizations, has the potential to provide novel insights and generate new hypothesis. Materials and Methods: We created StoryboardR: an R package and Shiny application designed to visualize real-word data from tumor registries. Results: StoryboardR facilitates the data visualization of real-word data from tumor registries captured in REDCapVR. The output is an interactive timeline that allows for a visual interpretation of the relationship between potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers and outcomes. Conclusions: StoryboardR is freely available under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology license and can be obtained from GitHub. StoryboardR is executed in R and deployed as a Shiny application for non-R users. It produces data visualizations of patient journeys from tumor registries.",
