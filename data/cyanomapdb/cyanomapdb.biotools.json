                "abstract": "As one of the essential life forms in the biosphere, research on cyanobacteria has been growing remarkably for decades. Biological functions in organisms are often accomplished through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which help to regulate interacting proteins or organize them into an integral machine. However, the study of PPIs in cyanobacteria falls far behind that in mammals and has not been integrated for ease of use. Thus, we built CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio.pro/), a database providing cyanobacterial PPIs with experimental evidence, consisting of 52,304 PPIs among 6,789 proteins from 23 cyanobacterial species. We collected available data in UniProt, STRING, and IntAct, and mined numerous PPIs from co-fractionation MS data in cyanobacteria. The integrated data are accessible in CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio. pro/), enabling users to easily query proteins of interest, investigate interacting proteins with evidence from different sources, and acquire a visual network of the target protein. We believe that CyanoMapDB will promote research involved with cyanobacteria and plants.",
