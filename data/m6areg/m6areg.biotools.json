                "abstract": "As the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic RNAs, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been discovered to play an essential role in cellular proliferation, metabolic homeostasis, embryonic development, etc. With the rapid accumulation of research interest in m6A, its crucial roles in the regulations of disease development and drug response are gaining more and more attention. Thus, a database offering such valuable data on m6A-centered regulation is greatly needed; however, no such database is as yet available. Herein, a new database named 'M6AREG' is developed to (i) systematically cover, for the first time, data on the effects of m6A-centered regulation on both disease development and drug response, (ii) explicitly describe the molecular mechanism underlying each type of regulation and (iii) fully reference the collected data by cross-linking to existing databases. Since the accumulated data are valuable for researchers in diverse disciplines (such as pathology and pathophysiology, clinical laboratory diagnostics, medicinal biochemistry and drug design), M6AREG is expected to have many implications for the future conduct of m6A-based regulation studies.",
