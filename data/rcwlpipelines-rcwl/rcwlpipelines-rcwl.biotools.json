    "description": "RcwlPipelines (For users) and Rcwl (For developers) are R and Bioconductor toolchain for bioinformatics tools and workflows. They are an R interface to the Common Workflow Language. The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for development of data analysis workflows that is portable and scalable across different tools and working environments. Rcwl provides a simple way to wrap command line tools and build CWL data analysis pipelines programmatically within R. It increases the ease of usage, development, and maintenance of CWL pipelines.",

We have developed Rcwl, an R interface to CWL, to provide easier development, use and maintenance of CWL pipelines from within R. We have also collected more than 100 pre-built tools and pipelines in RcwlPipelines, ready to be queried and used by researchers in their own analysis. A single-cell RNA sequencing preprocessing pipeline demonstrates use of the software.",
