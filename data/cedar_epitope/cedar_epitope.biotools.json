The specific molecular targets of adaptive T cell and B cell immune responses are referred to as epitopes. Epitopes derived from cancer antigens are of high relevance as they are recognized by anti-cancer immune cells. Detailed knowledge of the molecular characteristic of cancer epitopes and associated metadata is relevant to understanding and planning prophylactic and therapeutic applications and accurately characterizing naturally occurring immune responses and cancer immunopathology. CEDAR provides a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature and serves as a companion site to the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), which is focused on infectious, autoimmune, and allergic diseases. CEDAR is freely accessible at https://cedar.iedb.org/.",
