                "abstract": "Cancer-related epitopes can engage the immune system against tumor cells, thus exploring epitopes derived from non-coding regions is emerging as a fascinating field in cancer immunotherapies. Here, we described a database, IEAtlas (http://bio-bigdata. hrbmu.edu.cn/IEAtlas), which aims to provide and visualize the comprehensive atlas of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-presented immunogenic epitopes derived from non-coding regions. IEAtlas reanalyzed publicly available mass spectrometry-based HLA immunopeptidome datasets against our integrated benchmarked non-canonical open reading frame information. The current IEAtlas identified 245 870 non-canonical epitopes binding to HLA-I/II allotypes across 15 cancer types and 30 non-cancerous tissues, greatly expanding the cancer immunopeptidome. IEAtlas further evaluates the immunogenicity via several commonly used immunogenic features, including HLA binding affinity, stability and T-cell receptor recognition. In addition, IEAtlas provides the biochemical properties of epitopes as well as the clinical relevance of corresponding genes across major cancer types and normal tissues. Several flexible tools were also developed to aid retrieval and to analyze the epitopes derived from non-coding regions. Overall, IEAtlas will serve as a valuable resource for investigating the immunogenic capacity of non-canonical epitopes and the potential as therapeutic cancer vaccines.",
