    "description": "We have developed HVSeeker, a deep learning-based method for distinguishing between\nbacterial and phage sequences. HVSeeker consists of two separate models: one analyzing DNA\nsequences and the other focusing on proteins. This method has shown promising results on sequences\nwith various lengths, ranging from 200 to 1500 base pairs. Tested on both NCBI and IMGVR\ndatabases, HVSeeker outperformed several methods from the literature such as Seeker, Rnn-VirSeeker,\nDeepVirFinder, and PPR-Meta. Moreover, when compared with other methods on benchmark datasets,\nHVSeeker has shown better performance, establishing its effectiveness in identifying unknown phage\ngenomes",
