In total, it provides data on more than two million accessions, making an important contribution to unlocking the vast genetic diversity that lies deposited in >400 germplasm collections in 43 countries. EURISCO serves as the reference system for the Plant Genetic Resources Strategy for Europe and represents a significant approach for documenting and making available the world's agrobiological diversity. EURISCO is well established as a resource in this field and forms the basis for a wide range of research projects. In this paper, we present current developments of EURISCO, which is accessible at http://eurisco.ecpgr.org.",
