                "abstract": "Here, we reported the compendium of protein lysine modifications (CPLM 4.0, http://cplm.biocuckoo.cn/), a data resource for various post-translational modifications (PTMs) specifically occurred at the side-chain amino group of lysine residues in proteins. From the literature and public databases, we collected 450 378 protein lysine modification (PLM) events, and combined them with the existing data of our previously developed protein lysine modification database (PLMD 3.0). In total, CPLM 4.0 contained 592 606 experimentally identified modification events on 463 156 unique lysine residues of 105 673 proteins for up to 29 types of PLMs across 219 species. Furthermore, we carefully annotated the data using the knowledge from 102 additional resources that covered 13 aspects, including variation and mutation, disease-associated information, protein-protein interaction, protein functional annotation, DNA & RNA element, protein structure, chemical-target relation, mRNA expression, protein expression/proteomics, subcellular localization, biological pathway annotation, functional domain annotation, and physicochemical property. Compared to PLMD 3.0 and other existing resources, CPLM 4.0 achieved a >2-fold increase in collection of PLM events, with a data volume of ∼45GB. We anticipate that CPLM 4.0 can serve as a more useful database for further study of PLMs.",

                "abstract": "As a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) discovered decades ago, protein lysine acetylation was known for its regulation of transcription through the modification of histones. Recent studies discovered that lysine acetylation targets broad substrates and especially plays an essential role in cellular metabolic regulation. Although acetylation is comparable with other major PTMs such as phosphorylation, an integrated resource still remains to be developed. In this work, we presented the compendium of protein lysine acetylation (CPLA) database for lysine acetylated substrates with their sites. From the scientific literature, we manually collected 7151 experimentally identified acetylation sites in 3311 targets. We statistically studied the regulatory roles of lysine acetylation by analyzing the Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro annotations. Combined with protein- protein interaction information, we systematically discovered a potential human lysine acetylation network (HLAN) among histone acetyltransferases (HATs), substrates and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In particular, there are 1862 triplet relationships of HAT-substrate-HDAC retrieved from the HLAN, at least 13 of which were previously experimentally verified. The online services of CPLA database was implemented in PHP+MySQL+ JavaScript, while the local packages were developed in JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0).
