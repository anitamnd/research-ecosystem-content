The recent method ASTRAL-Pro has made strides by enabling multi-copy gene family trees as input and has been quickly adopted. Yet, its scalability, especially memory usage, needs to improve to accommodate the ever-growing dataset size. Results: We present ASTRAL-Pro 2, an ultrafast and memory efficient version of ASTRAL-Pro that adopts a placement-based optimization algorithm for significantly better scalability without sacrificing accuracy.",
