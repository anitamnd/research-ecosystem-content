description: 'BLAST Command Line Applications.


  The NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of

  local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or

  protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical

  significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and

  evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify

  members of gene families.
