                "abstract": "Motivation: Gene expression imputation has been an essential step of the single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis workflow. Among several deep-learning methods, the debut of scGNN gained substantial recognition in 2021 for its superior performance and the ability to produce a cell-cell graph. However, the implementation of scGNN was relatively time-consuming and its performance could still be optimized. Results: The implementation of scGNN 2.0 is significantly faster than scGNN thanks to a simplified close-loop architecture. For all eight datasets, cell clustering performance was increased by 85.02% on average in terms of adjusted rand index, and the imputation Median L1 Error was reduced by 67.94% on average. With the built-in visualizations, users can quickly assess the imputation and cell clustering results, compare against benchmarks and interpret the cell-cell interaction. The expanded input and output formats also pave the way for custom workflows that integrate scGNN 2.0 with other scRNA-Seq toolkits on both Python and R platforms.",
