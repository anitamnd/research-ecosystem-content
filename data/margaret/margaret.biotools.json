                "abstract": "Despite recent advances in inferring cellular dynamics using single-cell RNA-seq data, existing trajectory inference (TI) methods face difficulty in accurately reconstructing the cell-state manifold and cell-fate plasticity for complex topologies. Here, we present MARGARET (https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/Margaret) for inferring single-cell trajectory and fate mapping for diverse dynamic cellular processes. MARGARET reconstructs complex trajectory topologies using a deep unsupervised metric learning and a graph-partitioning approach based on a novel connectivity measure, automatically detects terminal cell states, and generalizes the quantification of fate plasticity for complex topologies. On a diverse benchmark consisting of synthetic and real datasets, MARGARET outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recovering global topology and cell pseudotime ordering. For human hematopoiesis, MARGARET accurately identified all major lineages and associated gene expression trends and helped identify transitional progenitors associated with key branching events. For embryoid body differentiation, MARGARET identified novel transitional populations that were validated by bulk sequencing and functionally characterized different precursor populations in the mesoderm lineage. For colon differentiation, MARGARET characterized the lineage for BEST4/OTOP2 cells and the heterogeneity in goblet cell lineage in the colon under normal and inflamed ulcerative colitis conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that MARGARET can scale to large scRNA-seq datasets consisting of âˆ¼millions of cells.",
