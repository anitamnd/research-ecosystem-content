                "abstract": "Pangenomics was originally defined as the problem of comparing the composition of genes into gene families within a set of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species. The problem requires the calculation of sequence homology among such genes. When combined with metagenomics, namely for human microbiome composition analysis, gene-oriented pangenome detection becomes a promising method to decipher ecosystem functions and population-level evolution. Established computational tools are able to investigate the genetic content of isolates for which a complete genomic sequence is available. However, there is a plethora of incomplete genomes that are available on public resources, which only a few tools may analyze. Incomplete means that the process for reconstructing their genomic sequence is not complete, and only fragments of their sequence are currently available. However, the information contained in these fragments may play an essential role in the analyses. Here, we present PanDelos-frags, a computational tool which exploits and extends previous results in analyzing complete genomes. It provides a new methodology for inferring missing genetic information and thus for managing incomplete genomes. PanDelos-frags outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstructing gene families in synthetic benchmarks and in a real use case of metagenomics. PanDelos-frags is publicly available at https://github.com/InfOmics/PanDelos-frags.",
