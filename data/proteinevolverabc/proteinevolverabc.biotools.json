                "abstract": "Motivation: The evolutionary processes of mutation and recombination, upon which selection operates, are fundamental to understand the observed molecular diversity. Unlike nucleotide sequences, the estimation of the recombination rate in protein sequences has been little explored, neither implemented in evolutionary frameworks, despite protein sequencing methods are largely used. Results: In order to accommodate this need, here I present a computational framework, called ProteinEvolverABC, to jointly estimate recombination and substitution rates from alignments of protein sequences. The framework implements the approximate Bayesian computation approach, with and without regression adjustments and includes a variety of substitution models of protein evolution, demographics and longitudinal sampling. It also implements several nuisance parameters such as heterogeneous amino acid frequencies and rate of change among sites and, proportion of invariable sites. The framework produces accurate coestimation of recombination and substitution rates under diverse evolutionary scenarios. As illustrative examples of usage, I applied it to several viral protein families, including coronaviruses, showing heterogeneous substitution and recombination rates.",
