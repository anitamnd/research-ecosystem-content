                "abstract": "DNA metabarcoding is an emerging approach to assess and monitor biodiversity worldwide and consequently the number and size of data sets increases exponentially. To date, no published DNA metabarcoding data processing pipeline exists that is (i) platform independent, (ii) easy to use [incl. graphical user interface (GUI)], (iii) fast (does scale well with dataset size) and (iv) complies with data protection regulations of e.g. environmental agencies. The presented pipeline APSCALE meets these requirements and handles the most common tasks of sequence data processing, such as paired-end merging, primer trimming, quality filtering, clustering and denoising of any popular metabarcoding marker, such as internal transcribed spacer, 16S or cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. APSCALE comes in a command line and a GUI version. The latter provides the user with additional summary statistics options and links to GUI-based downstream applications.",
