                "abstract": "Computer simulations play an important role in studies of non-random mating populations. Because of implementation difficulties, only very limited types of non-random mating schemes are provided in the currently available simulation programs. Starting with version 0.8.5, simuPOP provides a few mating schemes that can be used to simulate arbitrary non-random mating models. This article describes the concepts and methods behind these mating schemes and demonstrates their uses in a few examples, including partial self-mating, positive assortative mating, non-random outbreeding, and simulation of overlapping generations in age-structured populations. © The Author 2008.

                "abstract": "Summary: simuPOP is a forward-time population genetics simulation environment. The core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides a large number of objects and functions to manipulate populations, and a mechanism to evolve populations forward in time. Using this R/Splus-like environment, users can create, manipulate and evolve populations interactively, or write a script and run it as a batch file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design, simuPOP can simulate large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At a more user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic population genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios. © The Author 2005.
