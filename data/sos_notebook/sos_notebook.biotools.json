It also serves as the IDE for the SoS Workflow engine that allows the development and execution of workflows from Jupyter notebooks. SoS Notebook improving the readability and reproducibility of complex bioinformatic workflows by allowing them to be represented and executed from a Jupyter notebook interface.",

An environment that streamlines the entire processes of data collection, analysis, visualization and reporting of such multi-language analyses is currently lacking. Results: We developed Script of Scripts (SoS) Notebook, a web-based notebook environment that allows the use of multiple scripting language in a single notebook, with data flowing freely within and across languages. SoS Notebook enables researchers to perform sophisticated bioinformatic analysis using the most suitable tools for different parts of the workflow, without the limitations of a particular language or complications of cross-language communications.",
