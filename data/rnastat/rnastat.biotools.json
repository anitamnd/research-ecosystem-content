                "abstract": "The 3D architectures of RNAs are essential for understanding their cellular functions. While an accurate scoring function based on the statistics of known RNA structures is a key component for successful RNA structure prediction or evaluation, there are few tools or web servers that can be directly used to make comprehensive statistical analysis for RNA 3D structures. In this work, we developed RNAStat, an integrated tool for making statistics on RNA 3D structures. For given RNA structures, RNAStat automatically calculates RNA structural properties such as size and shape, and shows their distributions. Based on the RNA structure annotation from DSSR, RNAStat provides statistical information of RNA secondary structure motifs including canonical/non-canonical base pairs, stems, and various loops. In particular, the geometry of base-pairing/stacking can be calculated in RNAStat by constructing a local coordinate system for each base. In addition, RNAStat also supplies the distribution of distance between any atoms to the users to help build distance-based RNA statistical potentials. To test the usability of the tool, we established a non-redundant RNA 3D structure dataset, and based on the dataset, we made a comprehensive statistical analysis on RNA structures, which could have the guiding significance for RNA structure modeling. The python code of RNAStat, the dataset used in this work, and corresponding statistical data files are freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/RNA-folding-lab/RNAStat).",
