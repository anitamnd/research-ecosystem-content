                "abstract": "Identification of RNA-small molecule binding sites plays an essential role in RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. These small molecules are expected to be leading compounds to guide the development of new types of RNA-targeted therapeutics compared with regular therapeutics targeting proteins. RNAs can provide many potential drug targets with diverse structures and functions. However, up to now, only a few methods have been proposed. Predicting RNA-small molecule binding sites still remains a big challenge. New computational model is required to better extract the features and predict RNA-small molecule binding sites more accurately. In this paper, a deep learning model, RLBind, was proposed to predict RNA-small molecule binding sites from sequence-dependent and structure-dependent properties by combining global RNA sequence channel and local neighbor nucleotides channel. To our best knowledge, this research was the first to develop a convolutional neural network for RNA-small molecule binding sites prediction. Furthermore, RLBind also can be used as a potential tool when the RNA experimental tertiary structure is not available. The experimental results show that RLBind outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in predicting binding sites. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the combination of global information for full-length sequences and local information for limited local neighbor nucleotides in RNAs can improve the model's predictive performance for binding sites prediction.
