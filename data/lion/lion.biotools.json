                "abstract": "Understanding ncRNA–protein interaction is of critical importance to unveil ncRNAs’ functions. Here, we propose an integrated package LION which comprises a new method for predicting ncRNA/lncRNA–protein interaction as well as a comprehensive strategy to meet the requirement of customisable prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms its competitors on multiple benchmark datasets. LION can also improve the performance of some widely used tools and build adaptable models for species- and tissue-specific prediction. We expect that LION will be a powerful and efficient tool for the prediction and analysis of ncRNA/lncRNA–protein interaction. The R Package LION is available on GitHub at https://github.com/HAN-Siyu/LION/.",
