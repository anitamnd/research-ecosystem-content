                "abstract": "Motivation: Nowadays, epigenetic gene regulations are studied in each part of the biology, from embryonic development to diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, to quantify and compare CpG methylation levels of a specific region of interest, the most accessible technique is the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). However, no existing user-friendly tool is able to analyze data from all approaches of BSP. Therefore, the most convenient way to process results from the direct sequencing of PCR products (direct-BSP) is to manually analyze the chromatogram traces, which is a repetitive and prone to error task. Results: Here, we implement a new R-based tool, called ABSP for analysis of bisulfite sequencing PCR, providing a complete analytic process of both direct-BSP and cloning-BSP data. It uses the raw sequencing trace files (.ab1) as input to compute and compare CpG methylation percentages. It is fully automated and includes a user-friendly interface as a built-in R shiny app, quality control steps and generates publication-ready graphics.",
