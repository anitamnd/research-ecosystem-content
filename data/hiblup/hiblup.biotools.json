                "abstract": "Human diseases and agricultural traits can be predicted by modeling a genetic random polygenic effect in linear mixed models. To estimate variance components and predict random effects of the model efficiently with limited computational resources has always been of primary concern, especially when it involves increasing the genotype data scale in the current genomic era. Here, we thoroughly reviewed the development history of statistical algorithms used in genetic evaluation and theoretically compared their computational complexity and applicability for different data scenarios. Most importantly, we presented a computationally efficient, functionally enriched, multi-platform and user-friendly software package named 'HIBLUP' to address the challenges that are faced currently using big genomic data. Powered by advanced algorithms, elaborate design and efficient programming, HIBLUP computed fastest while using the lowest memory in analyses, and the greater the number of individuals that are genotyped, the greater the computational benefits from HIBLUP. We also demonstrated that HIBLUP is the only tool which can accomplish the analyses for a UK Biobank-scale dataset within 1 h using the proposed efficient 'HE + PCG' strategy. It is foreseeable that HIBLUP will facilitate genetic research for human, plants and animals. The HIBLUP software and user manual can be accessed freely at https://www.hiblup.com.",
