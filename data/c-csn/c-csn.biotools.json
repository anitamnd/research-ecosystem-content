                "abstract": "The rapid advancement of single-cell technologies has shed new light on the complex mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity. However, compared to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) suffers from higher noise and lower coverage, which brings new computational difficulties. Based on statistical independence, cell-specific network (CSN) is able to quantify the overall associations between genes for each cell, yet suffering from a problem of overestimation related to indirect effects. To overcome this problem, we propose the c-CSN method, which can construct the conditional cell-specific network (CCSN) for each cell. c-CSN method can measure the direct associations between genes by eliminating the indirect associations. c-CSN can be used for cell clustering and dimension reduction on a network basis of single cells. Intuitively, each CCSN can be viewed as the transformation from less “reliable” gene expression to more “reliable” gene–gene associations in a cell. Based on CCSN, we further design network flow entropy (NFE) to estimate the differentiation potency of a single cell. A number of scRNA-seq datasets were used to demonstrate the advantages of our approach. 1) One direct association network is generated for one cell. 2) Most existing scRNA-seq methods designed for gene expression matrices are also applicable to c-CSN-transformed degree matrices. 3) CCSN-based NFE helps resolving the direction of differentiation trajectories by quantifying the potency of each cell. c-CSN is publicly available at https://github.com/LinLi-0909/c-CSN.",
