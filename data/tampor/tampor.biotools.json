                "abstract": "Large scale −omics datasets can provide new insights into normal and disease-related biology when analyzed through a systems biology framework. However, technical artefacts present in most −omics datasets due to variations in sample preparation, batching, platform settings, personnel, and other experimental procedures prevent useful analyses of such data without prior adjustment for these technical factors. Here, we demonstrate a tunable median polish of ratio (TAMPOR) approach for batch effect correction and agglomeration of multiple, multi-batch, site-specific cohorts into a single analyte abundance data matrix that is suitable for systems biology analyses. We illustrate the utility and versatility of TAMPOR through four distinct use cases where the method has been applied to different proteomic datasets, some of which contain a specific defect that must be addressed prior to analysis. We compare quality control metrics and sources of variance before and after application of TAMPOR to show that TAMPOR is effective at removing batch effects and other unwanted sources of variance in −omics data. We also show how TAMPOR can be used to harmonize −omics datasets even when the data are acquired using different analytical approaches. TAMPOR is a powerful and flexible approach for cleaning and harmonization of −omics data prior to downstream systems biology analysis.",
